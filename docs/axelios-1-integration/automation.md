# Sequencer run automation using CopyComplete.txt

The sequencer writes a file called *CopyComplete.txt* to the root of each run directory when all raw data has been transferred from the instrument to its output location.
This signal file enables downstream automation such as uploading data to cloud storage or launching an analysis pipeline without manual intervention.

## Overview

A watcher script polls the sequencer output directory on a configurable interval.
It tracks the state of each discovered run directory using a hidden state directory (`.run_state/`) that contains per-run signal files.
Each run progresses through the following states:

| Signal file | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<run_id>.found` | Run directory detected; transfer is in progress |
| `<run_id>.transfer_complete` | *CopyComplete.txt* was detected; data is ready |
| `<run_id>.timed_out` | Transfer timeout elapsed; `transfer_timeout` was called |
| `<run_id>.submitted` | Analysis has been submitted |

The state directory persists across restarts of the watcher, so runs that were already submitted are not reprocessed.

## Automation use cases

### Upload to cloud or data transfer

Once `<run_id>.transfer_complete` is signalled, the `launch_analysis` hook can be replaced or supplemented with a transfer command.
Common approaches include:

- `aws s3 sync <run_dir> s3://<bucket>/<run_id>/` for AWS S3.
- `gsutil -m rsync -r <run_dir> gs://<bucket>/<run_id>/` for Google Cloud Storage.
- `rclone copy <run_dir> remote:<bucket>/<run_id>` for any rclone-supported endpoint.

If both a transfer and an analysis are needed, run the transfer inside `launch_analysis` and wait for it to complete before submitting the pipeline.

### Launching an analysis pipeline

The `launch_analysis` function receives the absolute path to the completed run directory.
Use it to submit a job to a scheduler (SLURM, LSF) or invoke a pipeline directly.
Example for XOOS germline pipeline:

```bash
launch_analysis() {
    local run_dir="$1"
    nextflow run germline_wgs/main.nf \
        --input "${run_dir}" \
        --outdir "${run_dir}/analysis" \
        -profile slurm
}
```

## Example watcher script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eu -o pipefail

    echo "  poll-interval      Polling interval in seconds (default: 300)" >&2
    echo "  transfer-timeout   Seconds to wait for CopyComplete.txt before timing out (default: 43200)" >&2
    exit 1

### Running the script

```bash
# Watch a specific directory with default poll interval (5 min) and timeout (12 hr)
bash watch_sequencer.sh /data/sequencer_output

# Override poll interval (60 s) and transfer timeout (24 hr)
bash watch_sequencer.sh /mnt/instrument_output 60 86400

# Run as a systemd service or in the background with logging
nohup bash watch_sequencer.sh /data/sequencer_output >> /var/log/sequencer_watcher.log 2>&1 &
```

### State directory layout

After several runs the state directory looks like this:

```text
/data/sequencer_output/
├── .run_state/
│   ├── 20260601_run001.found
│   ├── 20260601_run001.transfer_complete
│   ├── 20260601_run001.submitted
│   ├── 20260602_run002.found
│   └── 20260602_run002.transfer_complete   ← analysis not yet submitted
├── 20260601_run001/
│   ├── CopyComplete.txt
│   └── ...
└── 20260602_run002/
    ├── CopyComplete.txt
    └── ...
```

## Known issues

### CopyComplete.txt may not be created in rare cases

In rare circumstances *CopyComplete.txt* may never appear even though the run directory is otherwise complete (for example, after a software crash or power loss).
The transfer timeout implemented in the script will detect this and call `transfer_timeout` so operators can intervene.

### No indication of sequencing error in the signal file

*CopyComplete.txt* confirms that the instrument finished writing data — it does not indicate whether the run produced sufficient or valid data.
There is no clear automated workaround; always check alignment and yield metrics after analysis to confirm sequencing output is inline with expectations.
