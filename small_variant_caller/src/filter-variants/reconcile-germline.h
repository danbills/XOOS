/**
 * @brief Update VCF record fields based on genotype classification for germline variants.
 *
 * This function updates VCF INFO and FORMAT fields to reflect the predicted genotype classification
 * from germline variant filtering. It is specifically designed for updating records from GATK
 * Haplotype Caller VCF output files in the germline workflow.
 *
 * The function performs the following updates based on the genotype:
 * - Sets appropriate FILTER status (PASS for valid genotypes, FAIL for invalid ones)
 * - Updates INFO fields: AC (allele count), AF (allele frequency), AN (allele number)
 * - Updates FORMAT field: GT (genotype)
 *
 * For failed genotypes (kGT00, kGT0, and other invalid genotypes), the function normalizes
 * the genotype values to ensure VCF compliance:
 * - Haploid failures are forced to GT=1, AC=1, AF=0, AN=1
 * - Diploid failures are forced to GT=0/1, AC=1, AF=0, AN=2
 *
 * @param record VCF record to be updated. Must be a valid VcfRecordPtr.
 * @param genotype The predicted genotype classification from the germline filtering model.
 *                 Valid values include:
 *                 - kGT01: Heterozygous diploid (0/1)
 *                 - kGT11: Homozygous alternate diploid (1/1)
 *                 - kGT12: Compound heterozygous diploid (1/2)
 *                 - kGT1: Haploid alternate (1)
 *                 - kGT0: Haploid reference (0) - treated as failure
 *                 - kGT00 and others: Treated as failures
 *
 * @throws std::runtime_error If required INFO/FORMAT fields (AC, AF, AN, GT) are not present
 *                           in the VCF record header or cannot be set.
 *
 * @note This function assumes the VCF record contains the standard GATK fields and may not
 *       work correctly with VCF files from other variant callers.
 * @note The function modifies the input record in-place.
 * @note For multi-allelic records that have been split, ensure AC and AF arrays are properly
 *       sized before calling this function.

/**
 * @brief Reconcile one or more ML-predicted genotypes of variant records at a single diploid chromosomal position for
 * the germline workflow.
 *
 * This function is intended for variants in diploid regions (autosomes, male XY PARs, female X chromosome) only.
 * There should be at most 2 variants at a position because the organism is expected to be diploid.
 * Since the genotypes are expected to be independently predicted by machine learning models, this function resolves
 * ambiguities and conflicts in genotype assignments for variants at the same position.
 *
 * The function implements sophisticated logic to handle multiple variants at the same position:
 * - Single variants: Direct genotype assignment with wildcard ALT support for GT=1/2 or GT=1/1
 * - Two GT=1/2 variants: Combined into multi-allelic record with GT=1/2
 * - Single passing variants: Assigns appropriate genotype while failing others
 * - Mixed variant types: Combines SNVs/insertions with deletions when both have GT=0/1 or GT=1/2
 * - Ambiguous cases: Fails all variants with appropriate filter reasons
 *
 * @param vids Vector of variant IDs for all variants at this position. Must be non-empty.
 * @param in_records Vector of VCF records corresponding to the variant IDs. Must match `vids` size.
 * @param alt_wildcard_records Vector of VCF records with ALT="*" at this position. These correspond to an upstream
 * deletion overlapping with the GT=1/2 and GT=1/1 variants at this position. Can be empty.
 * @param out_records Output vector to append processed VCF records. Records are modified in-place
 *                   and include updated genotype fields, filter status, and format fields.
 * @param ml_genotypes Vector of genotype predicted for each input record. Must match `vids` size.
 * @param info_metadata Vector of INFO field metadata for the output VCF records
 * @param fmt_metadata Vector of FORMAT field metadata for the output VCF records
 *
 * @return Optional maximum reference position spanned by the REF allele of any variant that
 *         were assigned GT=0/1 or GT=1/2. Used to determine validity of wildcard ALT alleles at downstream positions.
 *         Returns nullopt if no variants were assigned GT=0/1 or GT=1/2.
 *
 * @details Genotype Assignment Logic:
 * - CASE 1: Single variant
 *   - GT=1/2 or GT=1/1 + wildcard: Creates multi-allelic record with GT=1/2
 *   - GT=1/2 alone: Fails with "multiallele_partner" filter
 *   - GT=0/1, GT=1/1: Direct assignment
 *   - GT=0/0: Fails with "false_positive" filter
 *
 * - CASE 2: Two passing variants, both GT=1/2
 *   - Creates multi-allelic record (shorter ALT for allele 1, longer ALT for allele 2)
 *   - All other variants, if they exist: Fail with "false_positive" filter
 *
 * - CASE 3: Single passing variant, either GT=0/1 or GT=1/1
 *   - Assigns genotype to passing variant
 *   - All other variants: Fail with "false_positive" filter
 *
 * - CASE 4: Two passing variants, a deletion and a SNV/insertion, both with either GT=0/1 or GT=1/2
 *   - Creates multi-allelic record with GT=1/2
 *   - All other variants, if they exist: Fail with "false_positive" filter
 *
 * - CASE 5: GT=0/0 or conflicting genotypes
 *   - Fails all variants with appropriate filters
 *
 * @note Multi-allelic Record Creation:
 * - Combines INFO fields (AC, AF, AN, etc.) according to VCF specification
 * - Merges FORMAT fields (AD, DP, etc.) for both alleles
 * - Preserves original GATK fields in custom FORMAT fields
 * - May fail if REF/ALT sequences cannot be properly formatted
 *
 * @note Filter Assignment:
 * - PASS: Valid genotypes (GT=0/1, GT=1/1, GT=1/2)
 * - FAIL: Invalid genotypes with specific failure reasons:
 *   - false_positive: GT=0/0 (classified as noise)
 *   - multiallele_partner: GT=1/2 without valid partner
 *   - multiallele_conflict: Valid genotype but conflicts with position consensus
 *   - multiallele_format: Cannot format multi-allelic REF/ALT sequences
 *
 * @warning Input Validation:
 * - All input vectors must have matching sizes (except alt_wildcard_records)
 * - VCF records must contain required INFO/FORMAT fields for updates
 * - Variant IDs must represent variants at the same chromosomal position
 *
 * @warning Memory and Performance:
 * - Input VCF records are modified in-place
 * - Processing time scales with number of variants at position (typically 1-2 variants expected)
