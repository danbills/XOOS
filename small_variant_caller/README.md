# Small Variant Caller

## Getting started

### Introduction

Small variants (i.e. single nucleotide variants, insertions, and deletions up to 50-bp in length) constitute the majority of genomic variations.
The detection of small variants has become an integral step in many bioinformatics analyses.

Small Variant Caller (SVC) analyzes SBX-Duplex (SBX-D) and SBX-Fast sequencing data in three main processes:

1. **Variant calling**: Call candidate variants based on alignments of SBX reads against the reference genome.
2. **Variant filtering**: Filter/re-genotype candidate variants using machine learning (ML) models.
3. **Model training**: Train machine learning models for variant filtering.

Typical use case involves variant calling followed by variant filtering.
Model training is only necessary for generating custom machine learning models for variant filtering.

![Introduction](docs/assets/introduction.svg)

#### 1. Variant calling

SVC is designed to work with variant calls from [GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us), a widely used analysis toolkit for high-throughput sequencing data.
Depending on the use case, either GATK HaplotypeCaller or Mutect2 is used to generate the candidate variants BAM and VCF files for variant filtering in SVC.

#### 2. Variant filtering

Since GATK HaplotypeCaller/Mutect2 is not designed and optimized to generate highly accurate variant calls directly from SBX data, SVC utilizes machine learning models to filter and re-genotype the candidate variant calls made by GATK HaplotypeCaller/Mutect2.
This results in a substantial improvement in variant call F1 scores for SBX data.

The `filter_variants` submodule in SVC filters GATK output variants using the model(s) generated from the `train_model` submodule.
Pre-trained models are provided for use with `filter_variants`, see the section [Pre-trained model files](#pre-trained-model-files).

#### 3. Model training

Three SVC submodules are involved in training machine learning model(s) for variant filtering:

- `compute_vcf_features`: Compute machine learning features from a GATK output VCF file.
- `compute_bam_features`: Compute machine learning features from a GATK output BAM file.
- `train_model`: Train machine learning model(s) using feature files generated from `compute_bam_features` and `compute_vcf_features`.

More details on each operational mode for different sample types can be found in the section [Usage](#usage).

## Usage

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `tumor-normal-wgs` workflow requires **mark-duplicate BAMs produced by Read Collapser `markdup`**, not inter-consensus BAMs.

If the input BAMs were already duplicate-marked by another tool, they **must still be re-run** through Read Collapser `markdup`.

BAMs derived from Read Collapser `consensus` output are intended for specialized applications such as ctDNA/cfDNA analysis and tumor fraction estimation, not this workflow.
{% endhint %}

Each use case is implemented as a dedicated sub-command:

| Sub-Command             | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `germline`              | Germline whole-genome sample analysis. Intended for single-sample model training and variant filtering with pre-trained single-sample models. |
| `germline-multi-sample` | Germline whole-genome sample analysis. Intended for multi-sample model training and variant filtering with pre-trained multi-sample models.   |
| `tumor-normal-wgs`      | Paired tumor-normal whole-genome sample analysis                                                                                              |
| `tumor-only-te`         | Tumor-only target enrichment sample analysis                                                                                                  |

### Germline whole-genome

{% tabs %}

{% tab title="Germline variant calling" %}

GATK HaplotypeCaller output BAM and VCF are required as input.
This step gathers all candidate small variants (regardless of PASS or FAIL) for SVC to filter and re-genotype.

**The input BAM (*ALIGNMENT.bam*) must be a mark-duplicate BAM (e.g., from Read Collapser `markdup`), not an inter-consensus BAM.**

Example command with recommended settings:

```bash
gatk HaplotypeCaller \
    -I ALIGNMENT.bam \
    -R REFERENCE.fa \
    --intervals TARGET.bed \
    -O GATK_OUTPUT.vcf.gz \
    -OVI \
    -bamout GATK_OUTPUT.bam \
    -OBI \
    -A AssemblyComplexity \
    -A TandemRepeat \
    -RF MappingQualityReadFilter \
    --activeregion-alt-multiplier 5 \
    --adaptive-pruning true \
    --enable-dynamic-read-disqualification-for-genotyping true \
    --mapping-quality-threshold-for-genotyping 1 \
    --minimum-mapping-quality 1 \
    --min-base-quality-score 6 \
    --native-pair-hmm-threads 4 \
    --smith-waterman FASTEST_AVAILABLE \
    --max-mnp-distance 0 \
    --tmp-dir /PATH/TO/TEMP/DIRECTORY
```

Key parameters for germline variant filtering:

- `-A AssemblyComplexity` and `-A TandemRepeat` produce additional VCF annotations for machine learning features in SVC.
- `--min-base-quality-score 6` skips discordant bases in duplex consensus reads.
- `--activeregion-alt-multiplier 5` is used to increase sensitivity.
- `--max-mnp-distance 0` splits MNVs into SNVs.
  - This is required to properly filter and re-genotype SNVs.

See the [GATK HaplotypeCaller user guide](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/9570334998171-HaplotypeCaller) for other parameters.
Runtime can be reduced by parallel processing of partitioned BAM files.
Alternatively, use [NVIDIA Clara Parabricks haplotypecaller](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/parabricks/latest/documentation/tooldocs/man_haplotypecaller.html), the GPU-accelerated counterpart of GATK HaplotypeCaller.

#### Input files for germline variant filtering

- GATK HaplotypeCaller output BAM and VCF files (and their indexes)
- Reference genome FASTA (and its index)
- SNV and indel model files
  - The paths in the above example are the pre-trained models for single sample trained SNVs and indels, respectively.
- Population allele frequency VCF (and its index)
  - Example: gnomAD population allele frequency VCF, i.e. [af-only-gnomad.hg38.vcf.gz](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/_details/gatk-best-practices/somatic-hg38/af-only-gnomad.hg38.vcf.gz;tab=live_object)
  - Required when using the pre-trained germline models, otherwise the prediction accuracy will be affected.
  - Not required if input custom models were trained without the `popaf` scoring feature.
  - Training models with the `popaf` feature improves model accuracy (by ~0.01% in F1 score).

#### Output files for germline variant filtering

| Default Name      | Description                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| output.vcf.gz     | Filtered output variant call VCF file  |
| output.vcf.gz.tbi | Filtered output variant call VCF index |

The output VCF file must not already exist in the output directory.
If the output VCF file name ends in `.gz`, the output is BGZF-compressed with a tabix index; otherwise it is uncompressed.

##### Added and modified fields in the output VCF for germline variant filtering

The `filter_variants` output VCF includes additional or modified fields from the germline filtering and re-genotyping process.
See [Understanding PRED_ML, GQ, and QUAL in the output VCF](#understanding-pred_ml-gq-and-qual-in-the-output-vcf) for interpretation details.

{% tab title="Germline model training" %}

Use the pre-trained models described in section [Pre-trained model files](#pre-trained-model-files) for germline variant filtering.
To train custom models (with more training samples, for example), this section describes how to do so.

The `train_model` submodule generates two models for SNVs and indels to perform multi-class classification to re-genotype germline variants.
The following diagram outlines the flow of data for model training using a single sample.

![Germline model training](docs/assets/germline-model-training.svg)

#### Example commands for germline model training

```bash
train_model germline \
    --positive-bam-features BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --positive-vcf-features VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --truth-vcfs TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --snv-output-file SNV_MODEL.txt.gz \
    --indel-output-file INDEL_MODEL.txt.gz \
    --threads 16
```

See [`train_model` overview and CLI options](#train_model-overview-and-cli-options) for all available parameters.

#### Input files for germline model training

Each training sample must have the following three input files:

1. Truth VCF file
    - The full path to the truth VCF file for the input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--truth-vcfs`.
2. BAM features file
    - The full path to the BAM features file for the input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--positive-bam-features`.
3. VCF features file
    - The full path to the VCF features file for the input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--positive-vcf-features`.

The truth VCF file must correspond to the sample being sequenced.
It must contain only high-confidence variant calls for the sample.
The truth label for each variant is extracted from the VCF FORMAT field `GT`.
For germline whole-genome samples, high-confidence variant calls can be obtained from the [Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) consortium](https://jimb.stanford.edu/giab/).

The input BAM and VCF features must be computed for the training sample via the `compute_bam_features` and `compute_vcf_features` submodules prior to running `train_model`.

Example commands to compute BAM and VCF features for one training sample:

```bash
compute_vcf_features germline \
    --genome REFERENCE.fa \
    --vcf-input GATK_OUTPUT.vcf.gz \
    --pop-af-vcf POPAF.vcf.gz \
    --threads 16 \
    --target-regions TARGET.bed \
    --output-file VCF_FEATURES.tsv \
    --output-bed VCF_REGIONS.bed

compute_bam_features germline \
    --genome REFERENCE \
    --bam-input GATK_OUTPUT \
    --threads 16 \
    --target-regions VCF_REGIONS.bed \
    --output-file BAM_FEATURES.tsv
```

Here, the `--target-regions` argument specifies the target regions of interest for the sample.
The `--output-bed` argument in `compute_vcf_features` specifies the output BED file that will be used as input to `compute_bam_features`.
This reduces the number of regions that need to be processed by `compute_bam_features` and speeds up the process.
See the sections [`compute_bam_features` overview and CLI options](#compute_bam_features-overview-and-cli-options) and [`compute_vcf_features` overview and CLI options](#compute_vcf_features-overview-and-cli-options) for more details.

The paths to the features TSV files must be listed in two files, one for BAM and one for VCF features.
The example below illustrates how input list files for a training sample can be generated for single-sample germline model training.

```bash
echo /path/to/sample1/BAM_FEATURES.tsv > BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/sample1/VCF_FEATURES.tsv > VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/sample1/truth.vcf > TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt

```

#### Output files for germline model training

| Default Name       | Description      |
|--------------------|------------------|
| snv-model.txt.gz   | SNV model file   |
| indel-model.txt.gz | indel model file |

The output model files must not already exist in the output directory.
If the output model file name ends in `.gz`, the output is gzip-compressed; otherwise it is uncompressed.

#### Tips for germline model training

- Single sample model training using the sub-command `germline` is optimized to train models using only chromosomes 1 to 3 of the sample.
  - The remaining chromosomes of the sample can then be used to evaluate the model's performance.
- Adjust training parameters as needed if training using a different number of samples or number of chromosomes.
  - If a model needs to be trained using multiple samples, use the sub-command `germline-multi-sample`.
  - See the tab for this sub-command for a full breakdown of how to train a model with multiple samples.

### Germline whole-genome with multi-sample models

{% tabs %}

{% tab title="Germline variant calling(*)" %}

(\*) Note that this is the same variant calling process as described in the tab for "Germline variant calling" under the "Germline whole-genome" section.
The same GATK HaplotypeCaller command with recommended settings can be used to generate the candidate variants BAM and VCF files for both single-sample and multi-sample model training and filtering.

GATK HaplotypeCaller output BAM and VCF are required as input.
This step gathers all candidate small variants (regardless of PASS or FAIL) for SVC to filter and re-genotype.

**The input BAM (*ALIGNMENT.bam*) must be a mark-duplicate BAM (e.g., from Read Collapser `markdup`), not an inter-consensus BAM.**

Example command with recommended settings:

```bash
gatk HaplotypeCaller \
    -I ALIGNMENT.bam \
    -R REFERENCE.fa \
    --intervals TARGET.bed \
    -O GATK_OUTPUT.vcf.gz \
    -OVI \
    -bamout GATK_OUTPUT.bam \
    -OBI \
    -A AssemblyComplexity \
    -A TandemRepeat \
    -RF MappingQualityReadFilter \
    --activeregion-alt-multiplier 5 \
    --adaptive-pruning true \
    --enable-dynamic-read-disqualification-for-genotyping true \
    --mapping-quality-threshold-for-genotyping 1 \
    --minimum-mapping-quality 1 \
    --min-base-quality-score 6 \
    --native-pair-hmm-threads 4 \
    --smith-waterman FASTEST_AVAILABLE \
    --max-mnp-distance 0 \
    --tmp-dir /PATH/TO/TEMP/DIRECTORY
```

Key parameters for germline variant filtering:

- `-A AssemblyComplexity` and `-A TandemRepeat` produce additional VCF annotations for machine learning features in SVC.
- `--min-base-quality-score 6` skips discordant bases in duplex consensus reads.
- `--activeregion-alt-multiplier 5` is used to increase sensitivity.
- `--max-mnp-distance 0` splits MNVs into SNVs.
  - This is required to properly filter and re-genotype SNVs.

See the [GATK HaplotypeCaller user guide](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/9570334998171-HaplotypeCaller) for other parameters.
Runtime can be reduced by parallel processing of partitioned BAM files.
Alternatively, use [NVIDIA Clara Parabricks haplotypecaller](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/parabricks/latest/documentation/tooldocs/man_haplotypecaller.html), the GPU-accelerated counterpart of GATK HaplotypeCaller.

`filter_variants` can also use multi-sample ML models to score and re-genotype GATK HaplotypeCaller variant calls, producing a re-genotyped output VCF.

#### Example command for germline variant filtering with multi-sample models

If using pre-trained multi-sample models, use the `germline-multi-sample` sub-command.

```bash
filter_variants germline-multi-sample \
    --bam-input GATK_OUTPUT.bam \
    --vcf-input GATK_OUTPUT.vcf.gz \
    --genome REFERENCE.fa \
    --snv-model /resources/model-germline-sbxd-multisample-snv.txt.gz \
    --indel-model /resources/model-germline-sbxd-multisample-indel.txt.gz \
    --pop-af-vcf POPAF.vcf.gz \
    --output-dir /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/DIRECTORY \
    --vcf-output FILTER_VARIANTS.vcf.gz \
    --threads 16
```

See [Pre-trained model files](#pre-trained-model-files) for model details and [`filter_variants` overview and CLI options](#filter_variants-overview-and-cli-options) for all available parameters.

#### Input files for germline variant filtering with multi-sample models

- GATK HaplotypeCaller output BAM and VCF files (and their indexes)
- Reference genome FASTA (and its index)
- SNV and indel model files
  - The paths in the above example are the pre-trained multi-sample models for SNVs and indels, respectively.
- Population allele frequency VCF (and its index)
  - Example: gnomAD population allele frequency VCF, i.e. [af-only-gnomad.hg38.vcf.gz](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/_details/gatk-best-practices/somatic-hg38/af-only-gnomad.hg38.vcf.gz;tab=live_object)
  - Required when using the pre-trained germline models, otherwise the prediction accuracy will be affected.
  - Not required if input custom models were trained without the `popaf` scoring feature.
  - Training models with the `popaf` feature improves model accuracy (by ~0.01% in F1 score).

#### Output files for germline variant filtering with multi-sample models

| Default Name      | Description                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| output.vcf.gz     | Filtered output variant call VCF file  |
| output.vcf.gz.tbi | Filtered output variant call VCF index |

The output VCF file must not already exist in the output directory.
If the file name ends in `.gz`, the output is BGZF-compressed with a tabix index; otherwise it is uncompressed.

##### Added and modified fields in the output VCF for germline variant filtering with multi-sample models

The `filter_variants` output VCF includes additional or modified fields from the germline filtering and re-genotyping process.
See [Understanding PRED_ML, GQ, and QUAL in the output VCF](#understanding-pred_ml-gq-and-qual-in-the-output-vcf) for interpretation details.

{% tab title="Germline MS model training" %}

Use the pre-trained models described in section [Pre-trained model files](#pre-trained-model-files) for germline variant filtering.
To train custom models (with more training samples, for example), this section describes how to do so.

The `train_model` submodule generates two models for SNVs and indels to perform multi-class classification to re-genotype germline variants.
The following diagram outlines the flow of data for model training with two samples.

![Germline multi-sample model training](docs/assets/germline-multisample-model-training.svg)

#### Example commands for germline multi-sample model training

If training with multiple samples, use the `germline-multi-sample` sub-command to indicate multi-sample training data.
This sub-command utilizes a different set of LightGBM hyperparameters optimized for the amount of training data compared to single sample model training.
The command below provides an example of multi-sample model training.

```bash
train_model germline-multi-sample \
    --positive-bam-features BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --positive-vcf-features VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --truth-vcfs TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --snv-output-file SNV_MODEL.txt.gz \
    --indel-output-file INDEL_MODEL.txt.gz \
    --threads 16
```

See [`train_model` overview and CLI options](#train_model-overview-and-cli-options) for all available parameters.

#### Input files for germline multi-sample model training

Each training sample must have the following three input files:

1. Truth VCF file
    - The full paths to the truth VCF file for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--truth-vcfs`, one file per line.
2. BAM features file
    - The full paths to the BAM features file for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--positive-bam-features`, one file per line.
3. VCF features file
    - The full paths to the VCF features file for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--positive-vcf-features`, one file per line.

The order of the samples must match across the input file lists for `--truth-vcfs`, `--positive-bam-features`, and `--positive-vcf-features`.

The truth VCF file must correspond to the sample being sequenced.
It must contain only high-confidence variant calls for the sample.
The truth label for each variant is extracted from the VCF FORMAT field `GT`.
For germline whole-genome samples, high-confidence variant calls can be obtained from the [Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) consortium](https://jimb.stanford.edu/giab/).

The input BAM and VCF features must be computed for each training sample via the `compute_bam_features` and `compute_vcf_features` submodules prior to running `train_model`.

Example commands to compute BAM and VCF features for one training sample:

```bash
compute_vcf_features germline \
    --genome REFERENCE.fa \
    --vcf-input GATK_OUTPUT.vcf.gz \
    --pop-af-vcf POPAF.vcf.gz \
    --threads 16 \
    --target-regions TARGET.bed \
    --output-file VCF_FEATURES.tsv \
    --output-bed VCF_REGIONS.bed

compute_bam_features germline \
    --genome REFERENCE \
    --bam-input GATK_OUTPUT \
    --threads 16 \
    --target-regions VCF_REGIONS.bed \
    --output-file BAM_FEATURES.tsv
```

Here, the `--target-regions` argument specifies the target regions of interest for the sample.
The `--output-bed` argument in `compute_vcf_features` specifies the output BED file that will be used as input to `compute_bam_features`.
This reduces the number of regions that need to be processed by `compute_bam_features` and speeds up the process.
See the sections [`compute_bam_features` overview and CLI options](#compute_bam_features-overview-and-cli-options) and [`compute_vcf_features` overview and CLI options](#compute_vcf_features-overview-and-cli-options) for more details.

The paths to the features TSV files must be listed in two files, one for BAM and one for VCF features.
The example below illustrates how input list files for 3 training samples can be generated for multi-sample model training.
Note the order of samples (e.g. `sample1`, `sample2`, `sample3`) must match in the BAM/VCF features TSV list files and the truth VCF list file.

```bash
echo /path/to/sample1/BAM_FEATURES.tsv > BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample2/BAM_FEATURES.tsv >> BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample3/BAM_FEATURES.tsv >> BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/sample1/VCF_FEATURES.tsv > VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample2/VCF_FEATURES.tsv >> VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample3/VCF_FEATURES.tsv >> VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/sample1/truth.vcf > TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample2/truth.vcf >> TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample3/truth.vcf >> TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt
```

#### Output files for germline multi-sample model training

| Default Name       | Description      |
|--------------------|------------------|
| snv-model.txt.gz   | SNV model file   |
| indel-model.txt.gz | indel model file |

The output model files must not already exist in the output directory.
If the file name ends in `.gz`, the output is gzip-compressed; otherwise it is uncompressed.

#### Tips for germline multi-sample model training

- Multi-sample model training using the sub-command `germline-multi-sample` is optimized to train models using 6 samples.
  - The training parameters used in this use case were chosen to optimize training for 6 whole-genome GIAB samples, with a left-out sample being used to evaluate the model's performance.
- Adjust training parameters as needed if training using a different number of samples or number of chromosomes.

### Tumor-normal whole-genome

{% tab title="Tumor-normal WGS variant calling" %}

GATK Mutect2 output BAM and VCF files are required as input.
This step gathers all candidate small variants (regardless of PASS or FAIL) from both tumor and normal samples for SVC to filter and identify somatic variation.

**The input BAMs (*TUMOR_ALIGNMENT.bam* and *NORMAL_ALIGNMENT.bam*) must be mark-duplicate BAMs (e.g., from Read Collapser `markdup`), not inter-consensus BAMs.**

Example command with recommended settings for **GATK version 4.3**:

- Using GATK versions other than 4.3 is not supported and will likely produce incorrect or missing VCF annotations that the ML model relies on, leading to degraded variant filtering performance or runtime errors.

```bash

```

Key parameters for somatic variant detection:

- `-A AssemblyComplexity` and `-A TandemRepeat` produce additional VCF annotations for machine learning features in SVC.
- `--min-base-quality-score 23` and `--base-quality-score-threshold 23` use only concordant bases in duplex consensus reads.
- `--max-mnp-distance 0` splits MNVs into SNVs.
  - This is required to properly filter and re-genotype SNVs.

See the [GATK Mutect2 user guide](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037593851-Mutect2) for other parameters.
Runtime can be reduced by parallel processing of partitioned BAM files.

Alternatively, use [NVIDIA Clara Parabricks mutectcaller](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/parabricks/latest/documentation/tooldocs/man_mutectcaller.html), the GPU-accelerated counterpart of GATK Mutect2.

NOTE: SVC was tested with output from Parabricks mutectcaller version 4.7, which is implemented to match GATK Mutect2 v4.3 and therefore does not support several flags available in later versions of GATK Mutect2 :

- `--pileup-detection` and `--min-pruning` are not available; the Parabricks defaults are used.
- `--recover-all-dangling-branches` is passed as a flag (no value) in Parabricks, whereas GATK takes a boolean value.
- The BAM index (`.bai`) is produced automatically by Parabricks; no explicit `--create-output-bam-index` flag is needed.

{% tab title="Tumor-normal WGS variant filtering" %}

`filter_variants` scores GATK Mutect2 variant calls using pre-trained ML models, producing a filtered output VCF with passing somatic variants.

![Tumor-normal WGS variant filtering](docs/assets/tumor-normal-wgs-variant-filtering.svg)

#### Example command for tumor-normal variant filtering

Pre-trained models are provided for the `tumor-normal-wgs` workflow for BWA-aligned data.
Cell line models were trained only on cell line samples while FFPE models were trained on a combination of FFPE and cell-line samples.
The table below summarizes the pre-trained models available for tumor-normal WGS variant filtering.

| Sample type | Aligner | Model file |
|---|---|---|
| FFPE | BWA | `/resources/model-tumor-normal-wgs-ffpe-bwa.txt.gz` |
| Cell line | BWA | `/resources/model-tumor-normal-wgs-cell-line-bwa.txt.gz` |

##### Model selection

For `tumor-normal-wgs`, the `--aligner` option accepts only `bwa` or `custom` (default); `giraffe` is not an accepted value and the CLI rejects it.
The `custom` option allows users to use their own custom-trained models with any aligner, as long as the model is compatible with the input features computed by SVC.

By default, the user must provide `--model` explicitly.

When `--aligner` is set to `bwa`, the model is automatically selected based on `--sample-type`.
The default sample type is `ffpe`.

`giraffe` is not an accepted `--aligner` value for the `tumor-normal-wgs` workflow because no pre-trained giraffe models are currently available.
The CLI rejects `--aligner giraffe`. For giraffe-aligned data, train a custom model using `train_model` and pass it via `--aligner custom --model`.

If `--model` is explicitly provided alongside `--aligner bwa`, the explicit `--model` takes precedence.

**Coverage range and performance:**

- The pre-trained models were trained on data within specific coverage ranges (see [Pre-trained model files](#pre-trained-model-files) for details).
  - **Performance is not guaranteed for data with tumor or normal coverage significantly above or below the ranges used during training.** Sequencing data that falls outside the training coverage range can yield a higher rate of false positives or false negatives than expected.

##### Default (custom aligner, explicit model)

```bash
filter_variants tumor-normal-wgs \
    --bam-input GATK_OUTPUT.bam \
    --vcf-input GATK_OUTPUT.vcf.gz \
    --genome REFERENCE.fa \
    --model /path/to/model.txt.gz \

```

##### BWA aligner (auto-resolved model)

```bash

See [Pre-trained model files](#pre-trained-model-files) for model and training data details, [`filter_variants` overview and CLI options](#filter_variants-overview-and-cli-options) for all available parameters, and [Balancing FP/FN trade-off using `QUAL` or `PRED_ML`](#balancing-fpfn-trade-off-using-qual-or-pred_ml) for tuning sensitivity and specificity.

#### Input files for tumor-normal variant filtering

- GATK Mutect2 output BAM and VCF files (and their indexes)
- Reference genome FASTA (and its index)
- Tumor-Normal model file (optional when using automatic model selection)
  - When `--model` is not provided, the model is automatically selected based on `--sample-type` and `--aligner`.
- Population allele frequency VCF (and its index)
  - Example: gnomAD population allele frequency VCF, i.e. [af-only-gnomad.hg38.vcf.gz](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/_details/gatk-best-practices/somatic-hg38/af-only-gnomad.hg38.vcf.gz;tab=live_object)
  - Required when using the pre-trained tumor-normal model, otherwise the prediction accuracy will be affected.
  - Not required if input custom models were trained without the `popaf` scoring feature.
  - Training models with the `popaf` feature improves model accuracy.
- Target regions BED file (optional, `--target-regions`)
  - When provided, only variants overlapping the specified regions are processed, which reduces runtime and memory usage.
  - For whole-genome sequencing this option is typically omitted.

#### Output files for tumor-normal variant filtering

| Default Name      | Description                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| output.vcf.gz     | Filtered output variant call VCF file  |
| output.vcf.gz.tbi | Filtered output variant call VCF index |

The output VCF file must not already exist in the output directory.
If the file name ends in `.gz`, the output is BGZF-compressed with a tabix index; otherwise it is uncompressed.

##### FILTER tags in the output VCF for tumor-normal variant filtering

The output VCF contains the following FILTER tags to describe the filtering status of each variant record.

| FILTER tag           | Description [default]                                            |

| `PASS`               | Site contains at least one allele that passes filters            |
| `ML_Score`           | Filtered due to low ML model prediction score                    |
| `max_indel_size`     | Filtered due to indel size exceeding maximum allowed size [`29`] |
| `max_normal_support` | Filtered due to high supporting reads in normal sample [`2`]     |
| `min_dp_ratio`       | Filtered due to low DP relative to chromosome median DP [`0.15`] |
| `min_tumor_af`       | Filtered due to low allele frequency in tumor sample [`0.05`]    |
| `min_tumor_support`  | Filtered due to low supporting reads in tumor sample [`1`]       |
| `missing_feature`    | Filtered due to missing ML feature                               |
| `non_acgt_ref_alt`   | Filtered due to non-ACGT reference or alt allele                 |

##### Added and modified fields in the output VCF for tumor-normal variant filtering

The `filter_variants` output VCF includes additional or modified fields from the tumor-normal filtering process.
See [Understanding PRED_ML, GQ, and QUAL in the output VCF](#understanding-pred_ml-gq-and-qual-in-the-output-vcf) for interpretation details.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Tumor-normal WGS model training" %}

Use the pre-trained models described in section [Pre-trained model files](#pre-trained-model-files) for tumor-normal variant filtering, specific to your sample type and aligner.
To train custom models (with more training samples, for example), this section describes how to do so.

The `train_model` submodule generates a model that can be used to filter SNVs and indels in a paired tumor-normal context.
The following diagram outlines the flow of data for model training with one sample.

![Tumor-normal WGS model training](docs/assets/tumor-normal-wgs-model-training.svg)

#### Example command for tumor-normal model training

```bash
train_model tumor-normal-wgs \
    --positive-bam-features POSITIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --positive-vcf-features POSITIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --negative-bam-features NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --negative-vcf-features NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --truth-vcfs TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --output-file MODEL.txt.gz \
    --threads 16
```

Here the `tumor-normal-wgs` sub-command is used to train a LightGBM model from one or more samples.
Samples can be replicates with different tumor purity.

See [`train_model` overview and CLI options](#train_model-overview-and-cli-options) for all available parameters.

#### Input files for tumor-normal model training

Each training sample must have the following five input files:

1. Truth VCF file
    - The full path to truth VCF files for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--truth-vcfs`, one file per line.
2. Positive BAM features file
    - The full paths to the Positive BAM features file for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--positive-bam-features`, one file per line.
3. Negative BAM features file
   - The full paths to the Negative/Healthy BAM features file for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--negative-bam-features`, one file per line.
4. Positive VCF features file
    - The full paths to the Positive VCF features file for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--positive-vcf-features`, one file per line.
5. Negative VCF features file
    - The full paths to the Negative/Healthy VCF features file for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--negative-vcf-features`, one file per line.

The order of the samples must match across the input file lists for `--truth-vcfs`, `--positive-bam-features`, and `--positive-vcf-features`.
Additionally, the order must also match between `--negative-bam-features`, `--negative-vcf-features`.

The truth VCF file must correspond to the positive sample used.
It must contain only high-confidence variant calls for the sample.
Any entries in the truth VCF are considered to be true positive somatic variants and only these variants are assigned a label of `1`.
Only data points from the positive feature set corresponding to a truth variant with a label of `1` are used as positives in model training.
All variants in the negative/healthy samples are given a label of `0`.
Variants that appear in the truth VCF(s) are excluded from the negative training data to prevent label conflicts.
NOTE: This process results in an uneven distribution of training examples with many more negative data points compared to positives used for model training.

When constructing the truth VCF, apply the following quality filters to reduce noisy labels regardless of sample type:

- **Remove low-confidence calls**: Filter out variants with low allele frequency (AF) in the tumor (e.g., AF < 5%), as these can reflect sequencing noise rather than true somatic variants.

All input BAM and VCF feature files must be computed for each training sample via the `compute_bam_features` and `compute_vcf_features` submodules prior to running `train_model`.

Example commands to compute BAM and VCF features for one training sample:

```bash
compute_vcf_features tumor-normal-wgs \
    --genome REFERENCE.fa \
    --vcf-input GATK_OUTPUT.vcf.gz \
    --pop-af-vcf POPAF.vcf.gz \
    --output-bed VARIANT_REGIONS.bed \
    --threads 16 \
    --output-file VCF_FEATURES.tsv

compute_bam_features tumor-normal-wgs \
    --genome REFERENCE.fa \
    --bam-input GATK_OUTPUT.bam \
    --target-regions VARIANT_REGIONS.bed \
    --tumor-sample-name TUMOR_SAMPLE_NAME \
    --threads 16 \
    --output-file BAM_FEATURES.tsv
```

The `--output-bed` option in `compute_vcf_features` writes the variant positions to a BED file.
Passing this BED to `compute_bam_features` via `--target-regions` restricts BAM feature computations to variant sites, which significantly reduces runtime and memory usage.

See the sections [`compute_bam_features` overview and CLI options](#compute_bam_features-overview-and-cli-options) and [`compute_vcf_features` overview and CLI options](#compute_vcf_features-overview-and-cli-options) for more details.

The paths to the features TSV files must be listed in two files for positive and negative samples, one for BAM and one for VCF features.
The example below illustrates how input list files for 3 positive and 3 negative training samples can be generated for model training.
Note the order of samples (e.g. `sample1`, `sample2`, `sample3`) must match in the BAM/VCF features TSV list files and the truth VCF list file.

```bash
echo /path/to/sample1/BAM_FEATURES.tsv > POSITIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample2/BAM_FEATURES.tsv >> POSITIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample3/BAM_FEATURES.tsv >> POSITIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/sample1/VCF_FEATURES.tsv > POSITIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample2/VCF_FEATURES.tsv >> POSITIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample3/VCF_FEATURES.tsv >> POSITIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/sample1/truth.vcf > TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample2/truth.vcf >> TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample3/truth.vcf >> TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/negative_sample1/NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES.tsv > NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/negative_sample2/NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES.tsv >> NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/negative_sample3/NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES.tsv >> NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/negative_sample1/NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES.tsv > NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/negative_sample2/NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES.tsv >> NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/negative_sample3/NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES.tsv >> NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

#### Tips for tumor-normal model training

- Current training parameters are arbitrarily selected and have not been optimized.
- Adjust training parameters as needed if training using a different number of samples or number of chromosomes.
- Use pairs of healthy samples (with no expected somatic variation) as negative training data.
  - Generating normal-normal pairs using the normal samples paired with a buffy coat from the tumor-normal pairs is a good option.
- Having a large imbalance between the number of negative samples relative to positive samples is expected, as all variants in a healthy normal are treated as negatives, whereas only known somatic variants are treated as positives.
- Use the `--output-training-data-tsv` option to export the assembled training feature matrix for inspection or debugging before model fitting.
- Ensure that the same settings for variant detection are applied to all training samples, whether healthy or tumor, to avoid introducing biases in the features used for model training.
  - While normal-normal pairs are not expected to have true somatic variants, they must still be processed using the same GATK Mutect2 commands to generate the BAM and VCF features for model training as tumor-normal pairs.

#### Varied genomic coverages in training data

**Include a range of sequencing coverages in your training data.** The ML model learns to distinguish true somatic variants from artifacts in part from depth-related features.
If the model is trained only on samples at a single coverage, it is unlikely to generalize well to samples at higher or lower depths.
Include training samples spanning the full range of coverage you expect in your production data (e.g., 25x to 170x tumor, 25x to 127x normal for the FFPE model).
**Performance is not guaranteed for data with coverage significantly above or below the range used during training.** In particular:

- Samples with much lower coverage than the training range can show increased false negatives due to the model not having learned to handle low-depth signals.
- Samples with much higher coverage than the training range can show increased false positives or unexpected behavior, as depth-normalized features can fall outside the distribution seen during training.

Include multiple tumor purity levels in training data, as the model needs to learn to call variants across a range of tumor allele frequencies.

#### Tips for cell line model training

Cell line samples are often accompanied by high-confidence, well-characterized somatic variant truth sets and are a good starting point for tumor-normal model training.

Recommended training data for a cell line model:

- **Samples**: Use well-characterized tumor cell line samples (e.g. HCC1395, H2009, HG008) paired with matched normal cell lines or blood normals.
  - Include multiple replicates to teach the model to call variants across a range of allele frequencies.
  - Use unrelated samples for training and testing to avoid overfitting.
- **Coverage**: Include training samples at varied coverage levels spanning the range expected in production data.
  - For example, the pre-trained FFPE model used between 25-170x tumor and 25-127x normal.
  - See [Varied genomic coverages in training data](#varied-genomic-coverages-in-training-data) for why coverage diversity matters.
- **Truth sets**: Use high-confidence somatic truth calls derived from orthogonal methods for cell lines with well-characterized mutational landscapes.
  - See [Input files for tumor-normal model training](#input-files-for-tumor-normal-model-training) for recommended truth set quality filters.
- **Negative training data**: Use normal-normal pairs of healthy normal samples (with no expected somatic variation) as described in the general [Tips for tumor-normal model training](#tips-for-tumor-normal-model-training).
  - Cell line normal controls or matched blood normals are appropriate.

#### Tips for FFPE model training

FFPE samples introduce unique sequencing artifacts (e.g., C>T deamination artifacts, fragmentation artifacts) that require specialized training data.
Building a robust FFPE model requires careful curation of both positive and negative training samples.

Recommended approach for FFPE model training:

- **Include real FFPE tissue samples**: At least some positive training samples must come from genuine FFPE-processed tissue, not just cell line proxies.
  - FFPE artifacts are tissue- and fixation-specific, and the model must be exposed to real FFPE signal to learn to distinguish artifacts from true somatic variants.
- **Truth sets for FFPE samples**: High-confidence somatic truth calls for FFPE samples can be derived from orthogonal high-quality sequencing of the same or matched tissue (e.g., fresh-frozen tissue).
  - Apply the standard truth set quality filters described in [Input files for tumor-normal model training](#input-files-for-tumor-normal-model-training).
  - In addition, be especially strict about removing low-AF calls and HP/STR variants for FFPE data, as deamination and fragmentation artifacts are more prevalent and more easily confused with real low-AF variants.
- **Include cell line samples as additional positives**: Cell lines provide reliable, deeply validated truth sets.
  - Including cell line samples as part of the positive training data strengthens the model's ability to call true somatic variants.
  - Use cell lines where the somatic truth set is well-established and high-confidence (e.g. HCC1395, H2009, HG008).
- **Paired normal requirements**: You must include **matched tumor-normal pairs where the normal sample is either blood or a non-FFPE tissue type**.
  - One of the normals in the pair must be a FFPE normal (normal tissue processed through FFPE) and another must be a blood normal from the same individual.
  - This normal-normal (NN) pairing—where one normal is FFPE and the other is blood—is used to train the model to distinguish FFPE artifacts (present in FFPE tissue but not blood) from true somatic variants.
- **Coverage range**: Include training samples across a range of coverage levels (e.g., 25x to 25x, 40x to 40x, 100x to 40x, 170x to 127x tumor-normal).
  - See [Varied genomic coverages in training data](#varied-genomic-coverages-in-training-data) for why coverage diversity matters.
- **Negative training data**: Use healthy paired normals, including FFPE normals, as negatives.
  - All variants in the negative samples are treated as artifacts or germline variation, providing the model with FFPE-specific background noise patterns to learn from.

{% tab title="Tumor-only TE model training" %}

Use the pre-trained model described in section [Pre-trained model files](#pre-trained-model-files) for tumor-only TE variant filtering.
To train custom models (with more training samples, for example), this section describes how to do so.

The `train_model` submodule generates a model that can be used to filter SNVs and indels to identify somatic variation.
The following diagram outlines the flow of data for one sample in model training.

#### Example command for tumor-only TE model training

```bash
train_model tumor-only-te \
    --positive-bam-features POSITIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --positive-vcf-features POSITIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --negative-bam-features NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --negative-vcf-features NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --truth-vcfs TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt \
    --output-file MODEL.txt.gz \
    --threads 16
```

The `tumor-only-te` sub-command trains a LightGBM model from one or more samples.
Each positive sample must have a matching truth VCF containing expected true positive calls.
See [`train_model` overview and CLI options](#train_model-overview-and-cli-options) for all available parameters.

#### Input files for tumor-only TE model training

Each training sample must have the following five input files:

1. Truth VCF file
    - The full path to truth VCF files for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--truth-vcfs`, one file per line.
2. Positive BAM features file
    - The full paths to the Positive BAM features file for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--positive-bam-features`, one file per line.
3. Negative BAM features file
    - The full paths to the Negative/Healthy BAM features file for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--negative-bam-features`, one file per line.
4. Positive VCF features file
    - The full paths to the Positive VCF features file for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--positive-vcf-features`, one file per line.
5. Negative VCF features file
    - The full paths to the Negative/Healthy VCF features file for each input sample must be listed in a file passed to `--negative-vcf-features`, one file per line.

The order of the samples must match across the input file lists for `--truth-vcfs`, `--positive-bam-features`, and `--positive-vcf-features`.
Additionally, the order must also match between `--negative-bam-features`, `--negative-vcf-features`.

Each truth VCF file must correspond to the respective positive sample.
It must contain only high-confidence variant calls for the sample.
Any entries in the truth VCF are considered to be true positive somatic variants and only these variants are assigned a label of `1`.
Only data points from the positive feature set corresponding to a truth variant with a label of `1` are used as positives in model training.
All variants in the negative/healthy samples are given a label of `0`.
NOTE: This process results in an uneven distribution of training examples with many more negative data points compared to positives used for model training.

All input BAM and VCF feature files must be computed for each training sample via the `compute_bam_features` and `compute_vcf_features` submodules prior to running `train_model`.

Example commands to compute BAM and VCF features for one training sample:

```bash
compute_vcf_features tumor-only-te \
    --genome REFERENCE.fa \
    --vcf-input GATK_OUTPUT.vcf.gz \
    --threads 16 \
    --output-file VCF_FEATURES.tsv

compute_bam_features tumor-only-te \
    --genome REFERENCE \
    --bam-input GATK_OUTPUT \
    --threads 16 \
    --tumor-sample-name TUMOR_SAMPLE_NAME \
    --output-file BAM_FEATURES.tsv
```

See the sections [`compute_bam_features` overview and CLI options](#compute_bam_features-overview-and-cli-options) and [`compute_vcf_features` overview and CLI options](#compute_vcf_features-overview-and-cli-options) for more details.

The paths to the features TSV files must be listed in two files for positive and negative samples, one for BAM and one for VCF features.
The example below illustrates how input list files for 3 positive and 3 negative training samples can be generated for model training.
Note the order of samples (e.g. `sample1`, `sample2`, `sample3`) must match in the BAM/VCF features TSV list files and the truth VCF list file.

```bash
echo /path/to/sample1/BAM_FEATURES.tsv > POSITIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample2/BAM_FEATURES.tsv >> POSITIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample3/BAM_FEATURES.tsv >> POSITIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/sample1/VCF_FEATURES.tsv > POSITIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample2/VCF_FEATURES.tsv >> POSITIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample3/VCF_FEATURES.tsv >> POSITIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/sample1/truth.vcf > TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample2/truth.vcf >> TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/sample3/truth.vcf >> TRUTH_VCF_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/negative_sample1/NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES.tsv > NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/negative_sample2/NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES.tsv >> NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/negative_sample3/NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES.tsv >> NEGATIVE_BAM_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

echo /path/to/negative_sample1/NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES.tsv > NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt
echo /path/to/negative_sample2/NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES.tsv >> NEGATIVE_VCF_FEATURES_FILE_LIST.txt

#### Understanding PRED_ML, GQ, and QUAL in the output VCF

{% tabs %}

{% tab title="germline / germline-multi-sample" %}

Germline variant filtering utilizes multi-class machine learning models that produce prediction probabilities for four genotype classes:

- `./.`: homozygous reference genotype
- `0/1`: heterozygous reference-variant genotype
- `1/1`: homozygous variant genotype
- `1/2`: heterozygous genotype with two different variant alleles

A variant with the `./.` genotype classification lacks sufficient evidence to support the variant call.
The other three classes are non-reference (i.e. variant) genotypes.
A variant's genotype classification is chosen using the highest prediction probability score.

In haploid regions, the genotypes are reduced to only two classes:

- `.`: reference genotype
- `1`: variant genotype

The following fields in the output VCF are derived from the prediction probabilities of the ML model:

- `PRED_ML` is the prediction probability score ranging between 0 and 1 for the predicted genotype, which is the direct output of the ML model.

- `GQ` is the genotype quality score calculated from `PRED_ML` of the predicted genotype.
  - It is calculated as `-10 * log10(1 - PRED_ML)`, which is the Phred-scaled confidence score for the predicted genotype.
  - A higher `GQ` score indicates a higher confidence in the predicted genotype.

- `QUAL` is the variant quality score calculated from `PRED_ML` of all variant genotypes.
  - It is calculated as `-10 * log10(1 - P(variant))`, where `P(variant)` is the sum of the prediction probabilities of all variant genotypes.
  - Therefore, `QUAL` is essentially the Phred-scaled confidence score for the variant being a true variant regardless of the specific genotype.

The original values for `GQ` and `QUAL` reported by GATK HaplotypeCaller are replaced to reflect the ML-based filtering and re-genotyping performed by `filter_variants`.

##### Creating an ROC curve for `germline` or `germline-multi-sample`

Since `QUAL` does not discriminate between heterozygous and homozygous genotype errors, plot ROC curves based on either `PRED_ML` or `GQ` instead of `QUAL` for a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance.

To create an ROC curve for `GQ`, first generate the data to plot using RTG vcfeval:

```bash
rtg vcfeval \
    -b TRUTH.vcf.gz \
    -c SVC_FILTER_VARIANTS_OUTPUT.vcf.gz \
    -t REFERENCE.sdf \
    --evaluation-regions REGIONS.bed \
    --decompose \
    --ref-overlap \
    --o OUTPUT_DIR \
    -f GQ
```

The above command will generate the ROC data for SNVs and indels separately:

- `snp_roc.tsv.gz` - ROC data for SNVs
- `non_snp_roc.tsv.gz` - ROC data for indels

Then, the ROC curve can be plotted using columns `false_positives` and `true_positives_call` for the X and Y axes, respectively.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="tumor-normal-wgs" %}

`tumor-normal-wgs` variant filtering utilizes a binary-classification machine learning model that produces the prediction probability for a variant.

The following fields in the output VCF are derived from the prediction probabilities of the ML model:

- `PRED_ML` is the prediction probability score ranging between 0 and 1 for the variant, which is the direct output of the ML model.

- `QUAL` is the variant quality score calculated from `PRED_ML` of the predicted genotype.
  - It is calculated as `-10 * log10(1 - PRED_ML)`, which is the Phred-scaled confidence score for the predicted genotype.
  - A higher `QUAL` score indicates a higher confidence in the variant.

- `GQ` is the genotype quality score.
  - It is identical to `QUAL` for `tumor-normal-wgs` variant filtering because the model is not designed to predict specific genotypes.

The original values for `GQ` and `QUAL` reported by GATK Mutect2 are replaced to reflect the ML-based filtering performed by `filter_variants`.

##### Balancing FP/FN trade-off using `QUAL` or `PRED_ML`

Both `QUAL` and `PRED_ML` can be used to balance the trade-off between false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) by applying a post-filtering threshold:

- Raising the threshold (stricter) reduces false positives but can increase false negatives (higher precision, lower sensitivity).
- Lowering the threshold (more permissive) recovers more true positives but can admit more false positives (higher sensitivity, lower precision).

**Recommended approach for setting the ML threshold:**

1. Generate an ROC curve using a truth-benchmarked dataset and RTG vcfeval (see [Creating an ROC curve for `tumor-normal-wgs`](#creating-an-roc-curve-for-tumor-normal-wgs)).
2. Identify the `PRED_ML` or `QUAL` operating point that achieves the FP rate desired for your application.
3. Pass the corresponding threshold to `--snv-min-ml-score` and `--indel-min-ml-score` (or filter the output VCF post-hoc on the `PRED_ML` field).

The default thresholds (`--snv-min-ml-score 0.03`, `--indel-min-ml-score 0.008`) represent a balanced starting point validated on internal data.
**Users are encouraged to tune these thresholds to achieve the FP rate that is appropriate for their use case and application.**

##### Creating an ROC curve for `tumor-normal-wgs`

To create an ROC curve for `PRED_ML`, first generate the data to plot using RTG vcfeval:

```bash
rtg vcfeval \
    -b TRUTH.vcf.gz \
    -c SVC_FILTER_VARIANTS_OUTPUT.vcf.gz \
    -t REFERENCE.sdf \
    --evaluation-regions REGIONS.bed \
    --decompose \
    --ref-overlap \
    --squash-ploidy \
    --sample "BASELINE_SAMPLE_NAME,TUMOR_SAMPLE_NAME" \
    --o OUTPUT_DIR \
    -f FORMAT.PRED_ML
```

Here, `PRED_ML` is a per-sample FORMAT field in the SVC output VCF, and the explicit `FORMAT.` prefix is used for clarity when selecting the score field for RTG vcfeval.
`BASELINE_SAMPLE_NAME` is the sample name in the truth VCF, and `TUMOR_SAMPLE_NAME` is the tumor sample name in the SVC output VCF.
These are required to ensure RTG vcfeval reads `PRED_ML` from the tumor sample rather than the normal sample.

The above command will generate the ROC data for SNVs and indels separately:

- `snp_roc.tsv.gz` - ROC data for SNVs
- `non_snp_roc.tsv.gz` - ROC data for indels

Then, the ROC curve can be plotted using columns `false_positives` and `true_positives_call` for the X and Y axes, respectively.

## Overview and CLI options

The following sections describe each SVC submodule's design and CLI arguments.

### `filter_variants` overview and CLI options

SVC `filter_variants` filters and re-genotypes GATK variant calls using pre-trained ML models.
Filtering behavior depends on the sub-command (use case) selected.

#### Design summary of `filter_variants`

- One or more coordinate-sorted and indexed GATK output BAM files are read via [htslib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib) to compute ML features.
- A coordinate-sorted, bgzip-compressed, and indexed GATK output VCF is read via [htslib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib) to compute ML features.
- BAM and VCF features are computed in the same manner as `compute_bam_features` and `compute_vcf_features`.
  - See sections [`compute_bam_features` overview and CLI options](#compute_bam_features-overview-and-cli-options) and [`compute_vcf_features` overview and CLI options](#compute_vcf_features-overview-and-cli-options) for an overview of these two submodules.
- Each variant allele in the VCF record is matched against the set of computed BAM and VCF features.
- Variants without matching BAM and VCF features are designated as FAIL in the FILTER column.
- The computed features for each variant are converted into a numeric vector and scored by a LightGBM model generated in `train_model` (see [`train_model` overview and CLI options](#train_model-overview-and-cli-options)).
  - Based on the score, variants are designated PASS or FAIL in the FILTER column.
  - For germline variants, the genotype can also be re-assigned.
- Variant filtering can be parallelized and/or restricted to target regions via the input BED file.
- Parallelization uses [Taskflow](https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow), splitting work into per-region tasks that process only overlapping BAM and VCF records.
- The output is a filtered and re-genotyped VCF file, which is coordinate-sorted, bgzip-compressed, and indexed.

### `train_model` overview and CLI options

The `train_model` submodule allows for the training of LightGBM models for variant filtering and re-genotyping.
SVC uses decision-tree-based ML models trained using LightGBM.
The exact specifics of how the models are trained and run are based on the use case and number of samples used to train the model.

The models used in the variant filtering process rely on features computed from the input BAM and VCF for the sample being filtered.
The `train_model` submodule takes as input files that list file paths to TSVs that contain pre-computed BAM and VCF features from the sample(s) that will be used for training the model(s).
Depending on the use case, training can require multiple samples.
In addition to the features files the `train_model` submodule requires a list of VCF truth files that contain true variant calls for the sample(s) that can be used to train the model.
The following sections break down model training for each of the supported use cases.

#### Design summary of `train_model`

- ML models are trained on BAM and VCF features using [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM).
- The BAM and VCF features for each variant are converted into a numeric vector.
- Numeric vectors for all variants are appended together into a single vector, which is the input for training a LightGBM model.
- Each variant in the training data is assigned a classification label based either based on its genotype (or lack thereof) in the truth VCF if training germline models, or if the variant occurs in a positive or negative sample if somatic.
- The outputs are one or more LightGBM model file(s).

### `compute_bam_features` overview and CLI options

Regardless of the use case or sub-command, the `train_model` submodule requires ML features to be computed from GATK BAM and VCF. `compute_bam_features` is a submodule within SVC designed specifically to compute features from BAM files from a single sample and generate an output TSV file.
Each line in the output TSV file contains the list of relevant ML features extracted from the BAM for a single candidate variant for model training.

#### Design summary of `compute_bam_features`

- One or more coordinate-sorted and indexed BAM files is read via [htslib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib) to compute ML features.
- At each alignment position, ML features are computed for both reference allele and alternate allele(s).
- Reference allele features are computed from alignment sequence matches.
- Alternate allele features are computed from mismatches, insertions, and deletions.
- Many ML features, such as the mean base quality (`baseq_mean`) of variants, can be computed.
- For a list of available BAM features, refer to the section [Model feature definition](#model-feature-definition)
- Feature computation can be parallelized and/or restricted to target regions via the input BED file.
- Parallelization uses [Taskflow](https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow), splitting work into per-region tasks that process only overlapping BAM records.
- The output is a tabular text file, where the rows are variants and the columns are computed features.

| --min-homopolymer-length           | Minimum length of homopolymer in reference. Only has an effect when `--filter-homopolymer alignment-end` is set. The `--min-homopolymer-length` value is used as a threshold to determine whether or not a stretch of identical bases in a read is considered a homopolymer. Only runs of identical bases greater or equal to the value of this parameter are considered homopolymers. | Integer > 0 [default: `4`]                                          |
| --duplex-lowbq                     | Include or exclude `duplex_lowbq` in `duplex_dp` and `duplex_af` feature calculations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | One of {`include`, `exclude`} [default: `include`]                  |

| --min-homopolymer-length           | Minimum length of homopolymer in reference. Only has an effect when `--filter-homopolymer alignment-end` is set. The `--min-homopolymer-length` value is used as a threshold to determine whether or not a stretch of identical bases in a read is considered a homopolymer. Only runs of identical bases greater or equal to the value of this parameter are considered homopolymers. | Integer > 0 [default: `7`]                                             |

### `compute_vcf_features` overview and CLI options

Regardless of the use case or sub-command, the `train_model` submodule requires ML features to be computed from GATK BAM and VCF. `compute_vcf_features` is a submodule within SVC designed specifically to compute features from a VCF file from a single sample and generate an output TSV file.
Each line in the output TSV file contains the list of relevant ML features extracted from the VCF for a single candidate variant for model training.

#### Design summary of `compute_vcf_features`

- A coordinate-sorted, bgzip-compressed, and indexed VCF is read via [htslib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib) to compute ML features.
- For each VCF record, ML features are computed for both reference allele and alternate allele(s).
- Many ML features, such as the allele depth (`alt_ad`) of variants, can be computed.
- For a list of available VCF features, refer to section [Model feature definition](#model-feature-definition).
- Feature computation can be parallelized and/or restricted to target regions via the input BED file.
- Parallelization uses [Taskflow](https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow), splitting work into per-region tasks that process only overlapping VCF records.
- The output is a tabular text file, where the rows are variants and the columns are computed features.

|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Parameter Precedence        | Each sub-command has its own set of default values and parameters, tailored for the associated use case. Explicitly setting a different value on the command line for the given parameter will take precedence over the default value and will be the one used by the submodule. This also applies when a config file is passed using the `--config` option. In this case, use case-specific defaults are set based on those provided in the JSON config file, however any values passed directly through the command line will overwrite those in the config file. |
| Inclusive Parameter Values  | Unless otherwise specified, all threshold cutoffs and minimum values used for variant filtering and feature computation are inclusive. For example a minimum base quality of 6 implies that a base with quality 6 will be included but one with quality 5 will be excluded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SNV               | **S**ingle **N**ucleotide **V**ariant. A single base mismatch against the reference genome at a given chromosomal position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Indel             | **In**sertion or **Del**etion. An insertion of one or more nucleotides into the reference genome at a given chromosomal position. A deletion of one or more nucleotides from the reference genome at a given chromosomal position.                                                                                                            |
| Germline Variants | Variants that are present in an individual's genome relative to a reference genome that were inherited from the individual's parents. As the human genome is diploid, having two copies of each autosomal chromosome, germline variants at a given reference position occur either on one chromosomal copy or both.                           |
| BAM               | **B**inary **A**lignment **M**ap. The BAM format is a compressed binary representation of the SAM (Sequence Alignment Map) format used for storing nucleotide sequence alignments to a reference genome. A BAM file sorted by reference genome positions can be indexed to allow random access to alignments at target reference position(s). |
| VCF               | **V**ariant **C**all **F**ormat. The VCF format is a text-based file format used for storing information about genetic variants such as SNVs and indels relative to a reference genome. VCF files can be compressed and indexed to allow for random access based on a given reference position.                                               |
| Genotype          | A classification given to germline variants to denote whether the variant is present in only one of the two chromosomes of the sample's genome (heterozygous) or both of the chromosomes (homozygous), or not present at all.                                                                                                                 |

| Model file        | A [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) ML model file. SVC utilizes the LightGBM framework to train gradient boosting decision tree ML models for filtering and re-genotyping variants.                                                                                                                            |

### Custom configurations

All SVC submodules except `vcf_to_bed` accept a configuration JSON file (`--config`) containing use case-specific settings for command-line arguments, model training parameters, and model feature lists.
Keys that correspond to command-line arguments can be overridden on the command line.

The default configuration file is `/resources/profiles_config.json` in the Docker image.
Use it as a template for custom configurations.

- "HC" refers to the high-confidence regions provided by the [Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) consortium](https://jimb.stanford.edu/giab/).
- "dedup" refers to the deduplicated coverage of the training data.

#### germline and germline-multi-sample pre-trained models

- Both single-sample and multi-sample germline pre-trained models can be used with the `germline` sub-command in `filter_variants`.
  - However, the exact settings for prediction can vary between the two sub-commands, resulting in possibly varied results and calls.
- Multi-sample pre-trained models:
  - They have better F1 scores and better support for high depth sequencing data compared to the single-sample pre-trained models, but they require more RAM.
  - They were trained for their intended aligner.
    - Using a pre-trained model on data aligned with a different aligner can result in suboptimal performance.
  - They were trained with 4 30x-dedup samples and 2 full-run samples with higher coverage.
  - Their training data have the following properties from XOOS Alignment Metrics:
    - `concordant_duplex_coverage (median)`: 29-83
    - `post_filter_read_length_excluding_soft_clipped_bases (median)`: 202-232
    - `all_errors_with_indel_bases (phred)`: 31.68-32.17
    - `hp_errors.tsv` (`hp_base=any`, `hp_length=10`, `phred`): 18.54-19.54
    - `hp_errors.tsv` (`hp_base=any`, `hp_length=8`, `phred`): 21.95-23.34
    - Using the models on data with significantly different properties than the training data can result in suboptimal performance.

#### tumor-normal-wgs pre-trained models

Two pre-trained BWA models are available for the `tumor-normal-wgs` workflow: an **FFPE model** and a **cell line / fresh-frozen model**.
Both were trained on BWA-aligned data.
Select the model that matches your sample type.

**Note:** No pre-trained giraffe models are currently available for tumor-normal-wgs.
`giraffe` is not an accepted `--aligner` value for `tumor-normal-wgs`; the CLI rejects it.
For giraffe-aligned data, train a custom model using `train_model` and provide it via `--aligner custom --model`.

**FFPE model** (`model-tumor-normal-wgs-ffpe-bwa.txt.gz`):

- **Aligner**: BWA.
- **Samples used in training**:
  - *Positive samples*: 3 FFPE tumor samples (real FFPE tissue), plus 2 cell line tumor samples (H2009 and HCC1395).
  - *Negative samples*: 1 FFPE normal sample (normal-normal pair, where one normal is FFPE-processed tissue and the other is blood from the same individual).
- **Coverage**: Multiple coverage levels per sample — full-run tumor-normal up to 170x tumor & 127x normal, 100x tumor & 40x normal downsampled, and 25x tumor & 25x normal downsampled.
  - This ensures the model generalizes across a range of depths.
  - **Performance is not guaranteed for data with coverage significantly outside the range of 25x to 170x tumor and 25x to 127x normal.**
- **Truth set**: High-confidence somatic calls, filtered to remove low-confidence calls (e.g., AF < 5% in the tumor) and variants in homopolymer (HP) and short tandem repeat (STR) regions.
- **Normal-normal pairs**: Training included matched pairs where one normal is FFPE-processed tissue and the other is a blood normal from the same individual.
  - This is critical for teaching the model to distinguish FFPE fixation artifacts from true somatic variants.
- **Recommended use**: FFPE tumor samples sequenced with SBX-D and aligned with the BWA aligner.

**Cell line / fresh-frozen model** (`model-tumor-normal-wgs-cell-line-bwa.txt.gz`):

- **Aligner**: BWA.
- **Samples and Coverages**: 7 tumor cell-line samples over 3 cell lines, chr1 left out:
  - HCC1395: full-run (~100x-100x), 100x-40x and 25x-25x.
  - H2009: full-run (~100x-100x), 100x-40x and 25x-25x.
  - HG008: full-run (179x-127x)
  - **Performance is not guaranteed for data with tumor or normal coverage significantly above or below these values.**
- **Truth set**: High-confidence somatic calls for each cell line, restricted to high-confidence regions.
- **Recommended use**: Cell line tumor samples sequenced with SBX-D and aligned with the BWA aligner.

#### BAM features

Features for both ALT- and REF-alleles extracted from alignment records in BAM files.

NOTE:

- "lowbq" features (with `_lowbq` suffix) are designated for reads with non-ACGT characters or low base quality in the homopolymer base(s) at or nearby the variant's start position.
  - The `--duplex-lowbq` option (or `duplex_lowbq` in config) controls whether "lowbq" duplex reads are included in the calculation of `duplex_dp` and `duplex_af` features.
- "nonhp" features (with `ref_nonhp_` prefix) are designated for reads supporting the REF-allele, where the sequence from the REF-allele's start position to the alignment end position is not a homopolymer.
- Any BAM feature can be computed for tumor and normal samples by attaching the `tumor_` and `normal_` prefixes, respectively.
  - Example: `tumor_duplex_af` and `normal_duplex_af` are derived from `duplex_af` for tumor and normal samples, respectively.
  - `bam_tn_af_ratio` is computed using `tumor_duplex_af` and `normal_duplex_af`.
    - So, `tumor_bam_tn_ratio` and `normal_bam_tn_ratio` would have the same value as `bam_tn_af_ratio`.

#### VCF features

Features for both ALT- and REF-alleles extracted from the VCF file, reference genome, and other associated resources (e.g. population allele frequencies).

NOTE:

- Features for short tandem repeats (i.e. `homopolymer`, `direpeat`, `trirepeat`, `quadrepeat`) are computed using the VCF fields `RU` and `RPA`.
  - If `RU` and `RPA` are not available, then the features are computed manually using reference sequence 100 bp after the variant position.

### SHAP value TSV column definition

The SHAP value TSV file contains the SHAP values for each feature used in the ML model for each variant prediction.
The SHAP value represents the contribution of each feature to the raw prediction score for the variant.

The columns are defined as follows:

| Name       | Description                                                     |
|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| VARIANT    | Variant ID represented as `chrom:pos:ref>alt`                   |
| GENOTYPE   | The ML model predicted genotype for the variant, if applicable. |
| PRED_ML    | The ML model predicted probability score for the variant.       |
| BASE_VALUE | The base value for the raw prediction score in the ML model.    |

All other columns represent the SHAP value for each feature used in the ML model, where the column name corresponds to the feature name.
See section [Model feature definition](#model-feature-definition).
