# Read Collapser

## Getting started

### Introduction

The Read Collapser module de-duplicates sequencing reads by either marking duplicates or collapsing them into consensus sequences. Both of these primary operations depend on an initial clustering step to group similar reads.

Read Collapser is designed as a post-alignment processing tool. It requires position-sorted aligned reads in BAM format as its input, typically the output from an aligner like bwa-mem or Giraffe followed by `samtools sort`. This input data can originate from various sequencing applications, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and Targeted Enrichment (TE). The purpose of the Read Collapser tool is to improve the accuracy and reliability of sequencing data analysis by reducing noise and correcting sequencing errors.

Reads are clustered based on their genomic alignment positions, specifically their start and end coordinates, and can be further separated by strand. If UMI (unique molecular index) tags are present in the reads, this information can also be used to refine the clustering process.

#### Sources of duplicates

The type of duplicates present in the data depends on the library preparation, for example:

- **SBX-D**: Duplicates arise from linear amplification and sequencing.
- **SBX-Fast**: All duplicates come from sequencing.
- **PCR-based protocols**: In addition to the above, PCR amplification introduces PCR duplicates.

#### Mark duplicates

The `markdup` subcommand identifies, marks, and optionally removes duplicate reads. Duplicate reads can arise in sequencing data from several sources, such as PCR amplification during the library preparation process. In the case of PCR, some molecules are amplified more efficiently or more times than others, leading to multiple copies of the same original molecule in the sequence data. Relying on these redundant copies can inflate read counts and bias downstream analyses.

To address this, the `markdup` subcommand considers all reads within each cluster as duplicates, except for the single highest-quality read of that cluster. These duplicate reads are then marked in the output BAM file's flag field, or they can be removed entirely.

Some [example applications](#example-applications) of duplicate marking are described below.

**Note:** For pangenome-aligned data, run [`read_collapser_rescue_secondary`](#rescue-secondary-alignments) before duplicate marking to recover reads whose primary alignment could not be projected to the linear reference.

#### Consensus

The `consensus` subcommand generates high-quality consensus sequences. Consensus leverages redundant information from multiple reads that originate from the same original molecule or genomic region to create a more accurate, "true" representation of that sequence. Random sequencing errors, DNA damage artifacts, or low-frequency variants can lead to false positive variant calls or an underestimation of true biological signals due to noise.

To address this, the `consensus` subcommand leverages evidence from all reads in a given cluster through a matrix-based approach. This method considers base calls and quality scores at each position across all aligned reads within the cluster to construct a robust and accurate final sequence. This significantly increases the confidence in variant calls and enhances the overall quality and reliability of sequencing data.

Some [example applications](#example-applications) of consensus are described below.

#### Example applications

|:-----------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Germline WGS (duplex)  | SBX-D, SBX-Fast  | To prevent artificial inflation of read depth and ensure accurate quantification of inherited variants by marking system duplicates and any residual amplification duplicates (if applicable). | Position + strand    | `markdup --preset wgs-duplex` |
| Germline WGS (simplex) | SBX-S YS P-D     | To mark system duplicates in simplex sequencing data while preserving full-length read prioritization and handling partial reads.                                                                    | Position         | `markdup --preset wgs-simplex` |
| Somatic WGS TN         | SBX-D FFPE       | To accurately quantify tumor allele frequencies and avoid biased read counts by marking duplicates from bulk sequencing.                                                                             | Position + strand    | `markdup --preset wgs-duplex` |
| Duplex cfDNA WGS       | SBX-D ctDNA/cfDNA | To achieve ultra-high sensitivity for cfDNA profiling and low-frequency ctDNA detection by correcting sequencing and linear amplification errors at the single-molecule level.                       | Position + strand    | `consensus --preset wgs-duplex-cfdna` |
| Somatic TE             | SBX YSU TE ctDNA | To increase the accuracy and sensitivity of somatic variant detection by correcting PCR and sequencing errors from reads of the same original molecule.                                              | Position + UMI       | `consensus --preset te-simplex` |

**For Small Variant Caller (SVC) workflows that expect BAM input, use the mark-duplicate BAM from `markdup`. The ctDNA/cfDNA WGS duplex preset (`wgs-duplex-cfdna`) outputs consensus FASTQs (and optionally a cluster BAM); any downstream "inter-consensus BAMs" are produced only after re-aligning those consensus FASTQs, and are intended for ctDNA/cfDNA applications such as tumor fraction estimation and cfDNA profiling, not standard SVC WGS input.**

##### When to cluster by strand

Read strand is determined by alignment to the reference genome. Strand-aware clustering (via the `--cluster-by-strand` flag) groups reads only if they align to the same strand. This is required for standard SBX-D and SBX-Fast (parent-parent duplex) protocols, where library preparation and amplification yield Xpandomers of the same orientation from a single original molecule. Enforcing this constraint prevents the clustering of reads from opposite strands, resulting in more accurate duplicate marking and consensus generation.

![Strand-aware clustering groups same-orientation reads](docs/assets/cluster-by-strand-same-orientation.svg)

Conversely, if the library preparation and amplification processes can produce Xpandomers of both orientations from a single original molecule, strand-aware clustering must be omitted. Enabling it would prevent these complementary reads from being grouped together. Because standard protocols for SBX-S (used in target enrichment and simplex WGS) and parent-daughter duplex sequencing produce Xpandomers in both orientations, the `--cluster-by-strand` flag must not be provided.

![Without strand-aware clustering, both orientations are grouped](docs/assets/no-cluster-by-strand-diff-orientation.svg)

The built-in presets are designed with these principles in mind, but the user must also consider the specific properties of their library preparation and amplification process when deciding whether to enable strand-aware clustering.

##### When to cluster by UMI

Certain adapter types allow for the tagging of reads with UMI (unique molecular index) tags. UMIs are short sequences that are added to both ends of the original DNA molecule during library preparation before any amplification steps. UMIs are trimmed from the read sequence during demultiplexing and are instead encoded in the read name. You should always enable UMI clustering (`--cluster-by-umi`) whenever your library preparation includes UMIs. By enabling UMI clustering, we can leverage this information to more accurately group reads that originate from the same original parent molecule.

## Usage

### Mark duplicates usage

The `markdup` subcommand identifies, marks, and optionally removes duplicate reads.

#### Mark duplicates example command

Mark duplicates with positional clustering for Germline WGS:

```bash
# input bam file must be indexed
read_collapser markdup \
  --preset wgs-duplex \
  --bam-input HG001.bam
```

This produces multiple output BAM files, one per thread. These BAM files are position-sorted and indexed, and they can be used directly in downstream analysis.

Additional common options:

- `--cluster-by-umi`: Enables UMI clustering.
- `--remove-duplicates`: Removes duplicate reads from the output BAM files instead of marking them.
- `--merge-output`: Merges output BAM files into a single position-sorted BAM file. Suitable for downstream tools that do not support multiple BAM files.
- `--mark-supplementary-alignments`: Marks supplementary alignments of duplicate reads as duplicates. Requires an additional read/write pass, which increases runtime.

For more details on the available command line options, see [Mark duplicates CLI options](#mark-duplicates-cli-options).

#### Mark duplicates input

- Position sorted BAM (and its index)
- Optional BED file

BED files must conform to the [BEDv1 specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/BEDv1.pdf). When a BED file is specified, Read Collapser utilizes the BAM index file (BAI) to efficiently find and process mapped reads that overlap one or more regions in the BED file. If the BAI file is not present when a BED file is provided, an error is thrown.

When `--cluster-by-umi` is enabled, UMIs are parsed from the read name. Read Collapser `markdup` assumes two UMIs (for the 5' and 3' ends) are present at the end of the read name, separated by `:` (legacy input delimits by `|`). The special character `*` is used to indicate a missing UMI. If the chemistry does not support UMIs, the UMI fields are omitted entirely from the query name. UMIs can be either alphabetic (the true UMI sequence, e.g., `AGCT`) or numeric (a UMI ID, e.g. `12`). All alphabetic UMI sequences must be in uppercase.

The input BAM can contain unmapped reads, which are treated as singleton clusters and not processed for duplicate marking. The unmapped reads are retained at the end of the last output BAM file.

Read Collapser clears any pre-existing duplicate flags (0x400) from the input BAM and sets them based solely on its own clustering logic. This allows it to be run on BAM files that were already duplicate-marked by another tool.
If a read is marked as duplicate in the input BAM but is not considered a duplicate based on Read Collapser's clustering logic, the duplicate flag will be cleared in the output BAM. Conversely, if a read is not marked as duplicate in the input BAM but is considered a duplicate based on Read Collapser's clustering logic, the duplicate flag will be set in the output BAM.

##### Rescued secondary alignments handling

In markdup mode, rescued secondary alignments (secondary alignments tagged with `YF:i:1`) are treated as primary alignments for the purposes of clustering and duplicate marking. These alignments are produced by `read_collapser_rescue_secondary` (see [Rescue secondary alignments](#rescue-secondary-alignments)), which identifies secondary alignments whose primary alignment is unprojectable to the linear reference and tags them with `YF:i:1` for downstream use.

Without this handling, rescued secondary alignments would be excluded from duplicate marking because markdup discards secondary alignments by default (`--exclude-flags 256`). In markdup mode (enabled by default), these alignments pass through the discard filter and participate in clustering alongside primary alignments.

This behavior is specific to markdup mode. In consensus mode, rescued secondary alignments are still discarded as usual.

The number of rescued secondary alignments is reported in the `rescued_secondary_alignments` metric in `summary_stats.tsv`.

#### Mark duplicates output

Files are written to an `output` folder in the current working directory by default. The output folder can be specified with `--output-dir`. If output files already exist, the command fails with an error unless `--overwrite` is specified.

| Default Name                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| *output.0000.bam.bai* ... *output.N.bam.bai* | A number of N BAI files where N is the number of threads specified by `--threads`. Each BAI file is the index of the correspondingly numbered BAM file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| *summary_stats.tsv*                          | Primary metric file containing statistics on clustering. Metrics irrelevant to the specified CLI command will have a value and percentage of `NA`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| *cluster_size_distribution_summary.tsv*      | Summary metrics of the cluster size distributions as indicated by each column header. These metrics are after clustering (and duplex decoding, if applicable).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| *cluster_size_distributions.tsv*             | The cluster size distributions as indicated by each column header. These metrics are after clustering (and duplex decoding, if applicable).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

If a BED file is provided, the output only contains reads that overlap one or more regions in the BED file.

If `--merge-output` is specified, the output will be a single position-sorted BAM file named *output.bam* with its index *output.bam.bai* instead of *output.0000.bam, ..., output.N.bam* and their respective BAI files.

Duplicates are either marked or removed from the output by specifying `--remove-duplicates`. Marking duplicates modifies the alignment record flag with the `BAM_FDUP` bit (0x400).

By default, each read (that was assigned to a cluster) will have 2 auxiliary tags added:

| Tag     | Type        | Definition                                                                                                     |
|:--------|:------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DI      | string `Z`  | A unique cluster ID. The numerical value is arbitrary and only serves to distinguish one cluster from another. |
| DS      | integer `i` | The number of reads in the cluster.                                                                            |

To disable this feature, use `--exclude-cluster-tags`.

#### Mark duplicates tips for analysis

##### Concatenating and indexing output BAM files

By default, `markdup` produces one BAM file per thread. Unmapped reads can be found at the end of the last BAM file. If your downstream analysis tool does not support multiple input BAM files, you can specify `--merge-output` when running `markdup` to produce a single position-sorted and indexed BAM file as output. Note that this will increase runtime and memory usage.

If you forget to use `--merge-output`, the output BAM files can also be merged with `samtools cat` and indexed with `samtools index`. The output BAM files must be provided to `samtools cat` in the correct order or `samtools index` will fail.

Example: Combining and indexing output BAM files

```bash
# the resulting BAM files are sorted and can be combined and indexed
# NOTE: BAM files must be provided in the correct order
samtools cat \
    output/output.0000.bam \
    output/output.0001.bam \
    ... \
    output/output.N.bam \
    -o output/output.merged.bam
samtools index output/output.merged.bam
```

Note: This is only necessary if your downstream analysis tool does not support multiple BAM files and you did not use `--merge-output` when running `markdup`.

##### Duplicate marking supplementary alignments

By default, supplementary alignments (with flag 0x800) are excluded from the duplicate marking logic but are retained in the output BAM(s). As a result, a supplementary alignment will not be marked as a duplicate, even if its corresponding primary alignment is marked as one.

To mark supplementary alignments of duplicates as duplicates, use the `--mark-supplementary-alignments` flag:

```bash
read_collapser markdup \
  --preset wgs-duplex \
  --mark-supplementary-alignments \
  --bam-input HG001.bam
```

When enabled, `markdup` performs a two-pass process: the first pass marks primary duplicates as usual, and the second pass re-reads the output to propagate the duplicate flag to supplementary alignments whose primary was marked as duplicate. Only primary duplicates that have an SA tag (indicating associated supplementary alignments) are tracked, so the memory overhead is proportional to the number of such reads. The second pass adds runtime due to the extra read/write cycle.

#### Mark duplicates performance and cost notes

Read Collapser `markdup` leverages Taskflow for parallelization and efficient resource utilization:

- Workload Distribution: The genomic data is split into independent super regions. The number of super regions corresponds to the number of `--threads`. This allows the workload to be distributed across multiple CPU cores or threads. Instead of processing the entire BAM file sequentially, multiple parts are handled simultaneously. Each super region can be further split into sub regions for better parallelism. The sub-region size (in base pairs) can be set with `--region-size`.
- Increased Throughput: By processing multiple super regions concurrently, the overall time to complete the duplicate marking operation is significantly reduced. This is particularly beneficial for large BAM files.
- Efficient Resource Management: Taskflow's `tf::Executor` efficiently manages the threads, allocating tasks to available cores and handling the underlying complexities of parallel execution. The number of threads can be specified with `--threads`.
- Scalability: The architecture is designed to scale with the number of available CPU cores. Increasing `--threads` (up to a reasonable limit dictated by hardware and I/O) can further reduce execution time.
- I/O Parallelization: Each super region gets its own reader and writer, meaning I/O operations (reading from the input BAM and writing to output BAMs) can happen in parallel, reducing I/O bottlenecks. This is why the number of output BAM files is equal to the number of `--threads`.
- Batching: Certain datasets can have extremely high coverage in certain regions of the genome due to over-enrichment or erroneous mapping during alignment. To address this issue, within each sub-region, alignments are grouped into batches to limit the amount of alignments processed simultaneously. This can be specified using the `--batch-size` option. A smaller batch size reduces memory usage but can decrease the accuracy of the clusters. With a small batch size, reads that would have otherwise been clustered together can be split into separate batches and thus separate clusters. On the other hand, a larger batch size results in more accurate clusters and duplicate-marked reads at the cost of increased memory usage. The recommended batch size is 300 000 reads, but this can be adjusted based on the available memory and the read depth.

### Consensus usage

The `consensus` subcommand generates high-quality consensus sequences.

#### Consensus example command

Consensus with positional and strand clustering for whole-genome duplex cfDNA analysis:

```bash
# input bam file must be indexed
read_collapser consensus \
  --preset wgs-duplex-cfdna \
  --bam-input HG001.bam
```

An additional common option:

- `--cluster-by-umi`: enables UMI clustering.

For more details on the available command line options, see [Consensus CLI options](#consensus-cli-options).

#### Consensus input

- Position sorted BAM (and its index)
- Optional BED file

BED files must conform to the [BEDv1 specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/BEDv1.pdf). When a BED file is specified, Read Collapser utilizes the BAM index file (BAI) to efficiently find and process mapped reads that overlap one or more regions in the BED file. If the BAI file is not present when a BED file is provided, an error is thrown.

When `--cluster-by-umi` is enabled, UMIs are parsed from the read name. Read Collapser `consensus` assumes two UMIs (for the 5' and 3' ends) are present at the end of the read name, separated by `:` (legacy input delimits by `|`). The special character `*` is used to indicate a missing UMI. If the chemistry does not support UMIs, the UMI fields are omitted entirely from the query name. UMIs can be either alphabetic (the true UMI sequence, e.g., `AGCT`) or numeric (a UMI ID, e.g. `12`). All alphabetic UMI sequences must be in uppercase.

The input BAM can contain unmapped reads, which are treated as singleton clusters for consensus. Placed unmapped reads (reads that have the unmapped flag `0x4` set but also a mapping position) are not supported and will be discarded.

#### Consensus output

Files are written to an `output` folder in the current working directory by default. The output folder can be specified with `--output-dir`. If output files already exist, the command fails with an error unless `--overwrite` is specified.

If a BED file is provided, the output only contains reads that overlap one or more regions in the BED file.

If `--output-cluster-bam` is enabled, each read (that was assigned to a cluster) will have 2 auxiliary tags added:

| Tag | Type       | Definition                                                                                                     |
|:----|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DI  | string `Z` | A unique cluster ID. The numerical value is arbitrary and only serves to distinguish one cluster from another. |
| DS  | integer `i`| The number of reads in the cluster.                                                                            |

Duplicate flags (0x400) from the input BAM (if any) are cleared in the cluster BAM output. Other flags and tags from the input BAM are retained in the cluster BAM output. The cluster BAM is not sorted or indexed.

Each consensus read is represented in the FASTQ output file as follows:

```text
@read_name
consensus_sequence (e.g. CACTGA)
+
base_qualities (e.g. III!II)
```

The `read_name` follows the format `[cluster_id]-[num_partial_fwd]-[num_partial_rev]-[num_full_fwd]-[num_full_rev]-[effective_cluster_size]`, where `-` is the delimiter. The `base_qualities` are ASCII encoded Phred quality scores.

Cluster size vs effective cluster size:

| Concept                  | Definition                                                                                               | Used for                                                                                                   |
|:-------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cluster size             | Count of reads assigned to a cluster during clustering (pre-consensus).                                   | Cluster size distributions and filtering (`--min-cluster-size`, `--max-cluster-size`).                      |
| Effective cluster size   | Average read support per consensus position (total bases in consensus matrix / covered positions). This can be lower than the raw cluster size when coverage is uneven. | Consensus read name annotation and strand-aware filtering (`--min-same-strand-cluster-size`, `--min-mixed-strand-cluster-size`). |

Why this distinction matters: cluster size tells you how many reads were grouped, while effective cluster size tells you how much support each consensus base actually had. Using both lets you tune clustering and consensus quality independently and interpret metrics correctly.

| Read name component    | Definition                                                                                                                        |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cluster_id             | The consensus read's unique cluster ID. The numerical value is arbitrary and only serves to distinguish one cluster from another. |
| num_partial_fwd        | The number of partial forward reads in the cluster used to generate the consensus read.                                           |
| num_partial_rev        | The number of partial reverse reads in the cluster used to generate the consensus read.                                           |
| num_full_fwd           | The number of full forward reads in the cluster used to generate the consensus read.                                              |
| num_full_rev           | The number of full reverse reads in the cluster used to generate the consensus read.                                              |
| effective_cluster_size | Average read support per consensus position (total bases in consensus matrix / covered positions). |

Since direction is unable to be determined for unmapped reads, the `read_name` will always follow the format `cluster_id-0-0-0-0-effective_cluster_size`, where `effective_cluster_size` is 1 unless `--duplex-library-type` is set to `parent-parent` or `parent-daughter`, in which case `effective_cluster_size` is approximated with `1 + round(concordant bases / (concordant bases + simplex bases + discordant bases))`.

All consensus reads are reported as forward strand (`+`) because Read Collapser assumes the aligner which mapped the reads in the input BAM would have taken the reverse complement of any reads mapping to the reverse strand. Under this assumption, Read Collapser only considers sequences based on the forward strand.

##### Per-base Read Support and Majority Count Tags

This information can be useful for debugging and understanding the consensus generation process, as it provides insight into how many reads contributed to each base in the consensus sequence and how many agreed with the final call.

If `--include-per-base-read-support-tags` is enabled, each consensus read will have 2 auxiliary tags added to the read name:

| Tag | Type       | Definition                                                                                                                       |
|-----|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ad  | string `Z` | An ASCII string that encodes the number of bases from forward reads that participated in majority voting at each position. |
| bd  | string `Z` | An ASCII string that encodes the number of bases from reverse reads that participated in majority voting at each position. |

If `--include-per-base-majority-count-tags` is enabled, each consensus read will have 2 auxiliary tags added to the read name:

| Tag | Type       | Definition                                                                                                               |
|-----|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| am  | string `Z` | An ASCII string that encodes the number of bases from forward reads that agree with the consensus base at each position. |
| bm  | string `Z` | An ASCII string that encodes the number of bases from reverse reads that agree with the consensus base at each position. |

For compactness, per-base read support and majority counts are encoded as ASCII strings similar to base qualities.
The auxiliary tags are separated from the read name and from each other by tab characters (`\t`).

The ASCII value of each character minus 33 gives the count at that position.
For example, if the first character of the `ad` tag is `I`, then the number of bases from forward reads that participated in majority voting at the first position is `40` (ASCII value of `I` is `73`, and `73 - 33 = 40`).
The length of each tag is equal to the length of the consensus sequence.

The read name with these tags would follow this format:

```text
[cluster_id]-[num_partial_fwd]-[num_partial_rev]-[num_full_fwd]-[num_full_rev]-[effective_cluster_size]   ad:Z:[ad_tag]   bd:Z:[bd_tag]   am:Z:[am_tag]   bm:Z:[bm_tag]
```

#### Consensus tips for analysis

For downstream analysis, the output FASTQ files can be combined with `cat` and piped into the next step, or processed individually.

Example:

```bash
# the resulting FASTQ files can be combined
cat output/output.*.fastq.gz | [NEXT STEP]
```

#### Consensus performance and cost notes

Read Collapser `consensus` leverages Taskflow for parallelization and efficient resource utilization:

- Workload Distribution: The genomic data is split into independent super regions. The number of super regions corresponds to the number of `--threads`. This allows the workload to be distributed across multiple CPU cores or threads. Instead of processing the entire BAM file sequentially, multiple parts are handled simultaneously. Each super region can be further split into sub regions for better parallelism. The sub-region size (in base pairs) can be set with `--region-size`.
- Increased Throughput: By processing multiple super regions concurrently, the overall time to complete the consensus generation operation is significantly reduced. This is particularly beneficial for large BAM files.
- Efficient Resource Management: Taskflow's `tf::Executor` efficiently manages the threads, allocating tasks to available cores and handling the underlying complexities of parallel execution. The number of threads can be specified with `--threads`.
- Scalability: The architecture is designed to scale with the number of available CPU cores. Increasing `--threads` (up to a reasonable limit dictated by hardware and I/O) can further reduce execution time.
- I/O Parallelization: Each super region gets its own reader and writer, meaning I/O operations (reading from the input BAM and writing to output FASTQs) can happen in parallel, reducing I/O bottlenecks. This is why the number of output FASTQ files is equal to the number of `--threads`.
- Batching: Certain datasets can have extremely high coverage in certain regions of the genome due to over-enrichment or erroneous mapping during alignment. To address this issue, within each sub-region, alignments are grouped into batches to limit the amount of alignments processed simultaneously. This can be specified using the `--batch-size` option. A smaller batch size reduces memory usage but can decrease the accuracy of the consensus reads. With a small batch size, reads that would have otherwise been clustered together can be split into separate batches and thus separate clusters. On the other hand, a larger batch size results in more accurate consensus reads at the cost of increased memory usage. The recommended batch size is 300 000 reads, but this can be adjusted based on the available memory and the read depth.

### Metrics

#### summary_stats.tsv

*summary_stats.tsv* is the primary metric file containing statistics on clustering and consensus (if applicable). Metrics irrelevant to the specified CLI command (e.g. consensus metrics when running duplicate marking) will have a value and percentage of `NA`.

The first line of the TSV file is the following header:

```text
metric_name value   percentage  denominator
```

The percentage is calculated by taking the value, dividing it by the value of the denominator metric, and multiplying by 100.

| Metric name                                            | Denominator                          | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Constraints                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Note:

- Each cluster results in a single consensus read, unless the cluster is discarded due to size filtering prior to consensus, or the consensus read is discarded due to length filtering after consensus.
- Records, alignments, and reads are similar but distinct concepts:
  - A record is a line in a BAM file, which can be a primary alignment, a secondary alignment, a supplementary alignment, or an unmapped read.
  - An alignment is a single alignment of a read to the reference genome. A read can have multiple alignments (e.g., one primary and one or more secondary/supplementary alignments).
  - A read is a DNA/RNA molecule that is sequenced. A mapped read can have one primary alignment and zero or more secondary/supplementary alignments. An unmapped read has no alignments.
- Only primary alignments are used for clustering and consensus, with the exception of rescued secondary alignments in markdup mode. However, all alignments (primary, secondary, supplementary) and unmapped reads are included in the `input_records` count and are subject to initial filtering by `--exclude-flags` and other filters.

#### cluster_size_distribution_summary.tsv

*cluster_size_distribution_summary.tsv* is a metric file containing summary statistics of the cluster size distributions as indicated by each column header. These metrics are calculated after clustering (and duplex decoding, if applicable) and before cluster size filtering and consensus, if applicable.

All distributions in this file use raw cluster size (read counts), not effective cluster size.

The first line of the TSV file is the following header:

```text
metric_name total_clusters  forward_strand_clusters reverse_strand_clusters mixed_strand_clusters   full_read_clusters  full_and_partial_read_clusters  partial_read_clusters
```

The distributions are defined below:

| Distribution Name                | Definition                                                 |

## Overview and CLI options

### Mark duplicates overview and CLI options

#### Mark duplicates design summary

Mark duplicates identifies, marks, and optionally removes duplicate reads, leveraging parallelization for performance.

1. Preparation & Parallelization
    - Input BAM/BED is divided into **super regions** (including special region for unmapped reads). The number of super regions is equal to the number of threads specified by `--threads`.
    - Separate readers/writers are initialized for each super region.
    - Taskflow orchestrates parallel processing of these super regions.
2. Per-Super Region Processing (Parallel)
    - Reads within a super region are read and filtered.
    - **Read Clustering**:
        - Reads are categorized as **full** (complete and untruncated on both ends) or **partial** (truncated on one end).
        - Full reads are clustered by either **position** or **UMI + position** (if UMIs are present and `--cluster-by-umi` is enabled).
            - In **Positional Clustering**, reads are primarily grouped by their **genomic start and end positions**. This method incorporates a configurable "wiggle room" (positional tolerance), allowing reads with slightly different but overlapping alignment coordinates to be considered part of the same cluster. This accounts for minor variations in read alignment. Overlapping clusters are recursively merged using a depth-first search to ensure comprehensive grouping within the specified `--wiggle-room` and `--cluster-by-strand` settings.
            - In **Positional + UMI-based Clustering**, when UMIs are present, reads are first clustered by their **UMIs** and then *further refined* by position (as described above). UMI clustering allows for more precise grouping of reads originating from the same original DNA/RNA molecule.
        - If `--exclude-partial-reads` is not enabled, partial reads are assigned to existing full read clusters based on nearest position and matching available UMI information (when `--cluster-by-umi` is enabled).
        - Any remaining, unassigned partial reads can be clustered together by position if `--make-clusters-of-partial-reads-only` is specified.
    - **Duplicate Identification**: Within each cluster, all reads are designated as duplicates *except* for a single representative read. Full-length reads are preferred over partial reads. Among the preferred group, the read with the **highest mean base quality** is selected. In the case of a tie, the first read in the group with the tied mean base quality is chosen.
    - Output Writing: Processed alignments are written to output BAM files. Duplicates are either flagged with the `BAM_FDUP` bit (0x400) or entirely removed if `--remove-duplicates` is enabled. Cluster information (cluster ID and size) is added to the BAM record but can be removed by `--exclude-cluster-tags`.
3. Finalization & Metrics
    - Global metrics from all tasks are aggregated.
    - Detailed statistics are written to TSV files.
    - Output BAM files are merged and indexed if `--merge-output` is specified.

Note: Supplementary alignments are not clustered regardless of the flags specified in `--exclude-flags`. Secondary alignments are also not clustered, with the exception of rescued secondary alignments (see [Rescued secondary alignments handling](#rescued-secondary-alignments-handling)).

#### Mark duplicates design diagram

![Mark duplicates design diagram](docs/assets/mark-duplicates-design.svg)

#### Mark duplicates CLI options

Parameters in **bold** are required. For parameters that control an on/off setting, such as `--cluster-by-strand`, Read Collapser uses a strict flag-only convention (i.e., providing the value `true` or `false` will fail).

##### Preset options (markdup)

| Argument                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Value(s)                                                                           |
|:-------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --preset                             | A preset parameter configuration for specified applications. To see application-specific defaults, run the desired preset with `--help`, or see the table below. Any parameters provided that conflict with the preset configurations will take precedence over the preset defaults.                                            | wgs-duplex, wgs-simplex, rna-bulk, none [default: none]                                         |

| Preset       | Configurations                                                                                                     |
|:-------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| wgs-duplex   | `--cluster-by-strand`, `--wiggle-room=0`                                                                     |
| wgs-simplex  | `--make-clusters-of-partial-reads-only`, `--wiggle-room=2`, `--wiggle-room-partial=0` |
| rna-bulk     | `--cluster-by-strand`, `--wiggle-room=0`                                                                     |

**Any parameters explicitly provided on the command line, even those conflicting with the active preset, will override the preset configurations.** For example, `--preset wgs-duplex --wiggle-room 5` will set the wiggle room to 5 instead of 0 (the `--preset wgs-duplex` default). Note that there is no command-line syntax to explicitly disable a boolean flag and override a preset that enables it.

If you need to disable a boolean flag that is enabled by a preset, you must not use the preset and manually specify all the desired parameters.

Note:

- The default `--exclude-flags` is 256 (secondary) for markdup. This is different from the default of 2304 (secondary and supplementary) for consensus.
- Setting `--min-mapq` to 1 or higher will exclude unmapped reads from the output as they always have a mapping quality of 0.

Supplementary and secondary alignments are not clustered regardless of the flags specified in `--exclude-flags`, with the exception of rescued secondary alignments (see [Rescued secondary alignments handling](#rescued-secondary-alignments-handling)). By default, supplementary alignments are passed through to the markdup output BAM unmodified, and non-rescued secondary alignments are excluded by the default `--exclude-flags=256`; rescued secondary alignments are still clustered and written to the markdup BAM.
To include unclustered and unmodified secondary alignments in the output BAM, set `--exclude-flags` to 0 or a value that does not include the secondary alignment bit (0x100).

### Consensus overview and CLI options

#### Consensus design summary

Consensus generates high-quality consensus sequences from sequencing reads, leveraging parallelization for performance.

1. Preparation & Parallelization
    - Input BAM/BED is divided into **super regions**.
    - Separate readers/writers are initialized for each super region.
    - Taskflow orchestrates parallel processing of these super regions.
2. Per-Super Region Processing (Parallel)
    - Reads within a super region are read and filtered.
    - Reads are categorized as **full** (complete and untruncated on both ends) or **partial** (truncated on one end).
    - **Read Clustering**:
        - Full reads are clustered by either **position** or **UMI + position** (if UMIs are present and `--cluster-by-umi` is enabled).
            - In **Positional Clustering**, reads are primarily grouped by their **genomic start and end positions**. This method incorporates a configurable "wiggle room" (positional tolerance), allowing reads with slightly different but overlapping alignment coordinates to be considered part of the same cluster. This accounts for minor variations in read alignment. Overlapping clusters are recursively merged using a depth-first search to ensure comprehensive grouping within the specified `--wiggle-room` and `--cluster-by-strand` settings.
            - In **Positional + UMI-based Clustering**, when UMIs are present, reads are first clustered by their **UMIs** and then *further refined* by position (as described above). UMI clustering allows for more precise grouping of reads originating from the same original DNA/RNA molecule.
        - If `--exclude-partial-reads` is not enabled, partial reads are assigned to existing full read clusters based on nearest position and matching available UMI information (when `--cluster-by-umi` is enabled).
        - Any remaining, unassigned partial reads can be clustered together by position if `--make-clusters-of-partial-reads-only` is specified.
    - Reads are output to BAM with any cluster information if `--output-cluster-bam` is specified.
    - Clusters are filtered by size and downsampled based on `--min-cluster-size` and `--max-cluster-size`, respectively.
    - If `--duplex-library-type` is set to `parent-parent` or `parent-daughter`, the duplex reads are decoded into their R1 and R2 components. This information is used to refine the consensus calling logic, especially for quality scoring and handling strand-specific discrepancies.
    - **Consensus Generation (per cluster)**:
        - Insertions are detected and aligned via **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)**.
        - A **Consensus Matrix** is built, aligning all reads in the cluster (including gaps/insertions).
        - **Majority Voting** determines the consensus sequence and quality scores, considering base counts, strand bias, and thresholds. See [consensus quality score models](#consensus-quality-score-models) for more information.
        - Consensus sequences are trimmed: any bases at the ends of the sequence that did not have at least `--min-trim-read-support` base counts (from Majority Voting) are removed from the sequence.
        - Consensus sequences are filtered: any sequence derived from a same-strand cluster or a mixed-strand cluster that does not have an effective cluster size of at least `--min-same-strand-cluster-size` or `--min-mixed-strand-cluster-size`, respectively, is discarded. The effective cluster size is calculated by the total number of bases in the consensus matrix divided by the number of covered positions.
        - Consensus sequences are written to gzipped **FASTQ** files.
3. Finalization & Metrics
    - Global metrics from all tasks are aggregated.
    - Detailed statistics are written to TSV files.

Supplementary and secondary alignments are not clustered regardless of the flags specified in `--exclude-flags`.

#### Consensus quality score models

There are two base-call quality score models available for consensus generation:

- The default, calibrated model: A calibrated model that is trained on empirical data to better reflect the true empirical error rates. This new model takes in additional context about the consensus base such as cluster size, strand bias, and whether the consensus base has both forward and reverse supports. It produces a wider and more continuous range of quality scores of 5, 10, 20, 22, 30, 40, and 50.
- The naive binomial model: Models the probability of a base being incorrect based on the sequencing error rate. This model produces categorical quality scores of 0 (for bases with low confidence), 18 (simplex bases), 35 (for bases with intermediate confidence), and 40 (bases with high confidence). The naive binomial model can be enabled using `--enable-legacy-qscore-model`.

#### Consensus CLI options

Parameters in **bold** are required. For parameters that control an on/off setting, such as `--cluster-by-strand`, Read Collapser uses a strict flag-only convention (i.e., providing the value `true` or `false` will fail).

**Any parameters explicitly provided on the command line, even those conflicting with the active preset, will override the preset configurations.** For example, `--preset wgs-duplex --wiggle-room 5` will set the wiggle room to 5 instead of 0 (the `--preset wgs-duplex` default). Note that there is no command-line syntax to explicitly disable a boolean flag and override a preset that enables it.

If you need to disable a boolean flag that is enabled by a preset, you must not use the preset and manually specify all the desired parameters.

| --exclude-partial-reads                  | Excludes partial reads during the clustering step.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | No value (omit to set false; include to set true)               |

Note: The default `--exclude-flags` is 2304 for consensus (secondary and supplementary). This is different from the default of 256 (secondary) for markdup.

Supplementary and secondary alignments are not clustered regardless of the flags specified in `--exclude-flags` and thus are not used for consensus generation.
Secondary and supplementary alignments are not included in the consensus process because they are not unique reads. Including them would cause the same original read to contribute multiple times to consensus generation, potentially biasing the results.

## Rescue secondary alignments

### Background

When reads are aligned to a pangenome graph (e.g. with `vg giraffe`), the aligner produces alignments in graph space. These are then projected back to the linear reference genome to produce a standard BAM file. However, some primary alignments cannot be projected — for example, when the primary alignment maps to a graph path that has no corresponding linear reference locus. These reads appear as unmapped primaries in the output BAM, even though the aligner found a valid graph alignment.

In many cases, the same read also has a secondary alignment that *can* be projected to the linear reference. Without intervention, these reads are lost to downstream analysis: the primary is unmapped, so duplicate marking and variant calling ignore them entirely.

`read_collapser_rescue_secondary` recovers these reads by identifying unmapped primaries and rescuing a high-quality secondary alignment (based on alignment score relative to read length) to represent the read in downstream processing. Rescued secondaries are tagged with `YF:i:1` so they can be tracked downstream.

### When to use

Run `read_collapser_rescue_secondary` **before** `read_collapser markdup` on pangenome-aligned BAM data. This ensures that rescued reads participate in duplicate marking and consensus calling, preventing systematic dropout of reads at loci where the pangenome graph diverges from the linear reference.

```bash
# Collated mode: pipe directly from the aligner
vg giraffe ... | read_collapser_rescue_secondary --collated

# Non-collated mode: from an existing BAM file
read_collapser_rescue_secondary --bam aligned.bam
```

### Assumptions and limitations

- **One primary alignment per QNAME.** The tool expects exactly one primary
  alignment per read name. Non-collated mode raises an error if a QNAME has
  multiple unmapped primaries. Collated mode only processes the first primary
  encountered per group.
- **Rescued secondaries retain the `BAM_FSECONDARY` flag.** The rescued
  alignment is tagged with `YF:i:1` but its secondary flag is not cleared.
  Downstream tools that filter on BAM flags (including `read_collapser markdup`)
  will still treat it as a secondary alignment. The `YF` tag is intended for
  downstream processes that explicitly look for rescued reads.
- **Collated mode: primary must be the first record per QNAME group.** If the
  primary appears after secondaries in a group, those earlier secondaries will
  not be considered for rescue. This ordering is produced by `vg giraffe` (when
  piped directly) and `samtools collate`.
- **AS tag required for rescue eligibility.** Secondaries without an `AS`
  (alignment score) auxiliary tag are never rescued, regardless of mapping
  quality or other indicators.
- **Non-collated mode memory.** Pass 1 stores all unmapped primary QNAMEs in
  memory (pre-reserved for 20 M entries). For WGS datasets this can require
  significant memory. The `--threads` option controls htslib I/O threads but
  does not parallelize the rescue logic itself.

### Input

`read_collapser_rescue_secondary` accepts a BAM file via `--bam`, or reads from stdin when `--bam` is `-` (the default). The input BAM can be in any read order when using non-collated mode, as the tool performs a two-pass scan. When `--collated` is specified, records must be grouped by read name (collated), enabling single-pass processing suitable for piping directly from an aligner. In collated mode, the primary alignment is expected to be the first record in each read name group (the ordering produced by `vg giraffe` and `samtools collate`); an error is raised if the first record is not a primary alignment.

### Output

Files are written to the current working directory by default. The output directory can be specified with `--output-dir`. If output files already exist, they will not be overwritten unless `--overwrite` is specified.

| *rescued_secondary.bam* | Output BAM containing all primary and supplementary records, plus any rescued secondary alignments tagged with `YF:i:1`. |
| *metrics/rescue_secondary_metrics.tsv* | Metric file containing counts of records processed. |

If `--prefix` is specified, output files are named *\<prefix\>.rescued_secondary.bam* and *metrics/\<prefix\>.rescue_secondary_metrics.tsv*.

**Output record selection:** The output BAM contains all primary and supplementary alignments from the input. For each read whose primary alignment is unmapped, at most one secondary alignment is rescued (the first mapped secondary meeting the `--min-alignment-score-ratio` threshold) and written with a `YF:i:1` tag. Secondary alignments that are not rescued are omitted from the output.

Rescued secondary alignments are tagged with the following auxiliary tag:

| Tag | Type | Definition |
|:---|:---|:---|
| YF | integer `i` | Set to `1` to indicate the record is a rescued secondary alignment. |

### Rescue secondary metrics

Metrics are written to a `metrics/` subdirectory within the `--output-dir`.

#### rescue_secondary_metrics.tsv

*rescue_secondary_metrics.tsv* is a metric file containing counts of records processed during rescue secondary alignment. The first line of the TSV file is the following header:

```text
metric_name value percentage denominator
```

The metrics are defined below:

| Metric Name | Denominator | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `num_records` | NA | Total number of records in the input BAM. |
| `num_primary_records` | `num_records` | Number of primary alignment records. |
| `num_secondary_records` | `num_records` | Number of secondary alignment records. |
| `num_supplementary_records` | `num_records` | Number of supplementary alignment records. |
| `num_rescued_secondary_records` | `num_records` | Number of secondary alignments rescued (tagged with `YF:i:1`) because their primary alignment was unmapped. |

### CLI options

Parameters in **bold** are required. For parameters that control an on/off setting, such as `--collated`, Read Collapser uses a strict flag-only convention (i.e., providing the value `true` or `false` will fail).

#### Input options

| Argument | Description | Value(s) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `--bam` | Input BAM path or `-` for stdin. | File path or `-` [default: `-`] |

#### Output options

| Argument | Description | Value(s) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `--output-dir` | Directory for output file(s) and metrics. | Directory path [default: `.`] |
| `--prefix` | Prefix prepended to output filenames. | String |
| `--overwrite` | Overwrite existing output files. | No value (omit to set false; include to set true) |

#### Rescue options

| Argument | Description | Value(s) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `--collated` | Input is collated (records grouped by read name for single-pass processing). | No value (omit to set false; include to set true) |
| `--min-alignment-score-ratio` | Minimum alignment score (AS tag) to read length ratio for a secondary alignment to be eligible for rescue. A secondary is rescued when AS / read_length ≥ this value. Values greater than 1.0 are valid when the aligner's scoring scheme produces AS scores exceeding read length. | Non-negative float [default: `0.8`] |

#### Performance options

| Argument | Description | Value(s) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `--threads` | The number of threads to use. | Non-negative integer [default: 1] |

#### Help options

| Argument | Description | Value(s) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `-h, --help` | Print usage | |

If you are certain your data consists entirely of full-length reads with no UMIs, you can use the hidden option `--ignore-read-name-parsing-errors` to bypass this check. Unparseable reads will be treated as full reads with both SIDs present and no UMIs. Do not use this option if your data is expected to contain UMIs or partial reads, as it will silently produce incorrect results. |

| Read Collapser                    | A module designed to process sequencing reads by identifying and either marking/removing duplicate reads or generating consensus sequences from them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Duplicate Reads                   | Multiple sequencing reads that originate from the same original DNA or RNA molecule. They primarily arise from PCR amplification during library preparation and can artificially inflate read counts and bias downstream analyses if not handled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Consensus Reads                   | High-quality, error-corrected sequences generated by computationally combining information from multiple individual sequencing reads that originated from the same original molecule or genomic region. This process filters out random errors and artifacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Clustering                        | The process of grouping individual sequencing reads that are determined to be related, typically based on their genomic alignment positions, strand, and/or UMI (unique molecular index) tags, as a crucial prerequisite for either duplicate marking or consensus generation.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Positional Clustering             | A clustering method where reads are grouped based on their genomic start and end positions. This method often includes a "wiggle room" or positional tolerance to account for minor variations in read alignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| UMI (unique molecular index) | A short, unique, random barcode sequence ligated to individual DNA or RNA molecules before PCR amplification. UMIs allow all PCR copies of a single original molecule to be identified and grouped, enabling true single-molecule error correction through consensus building.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| UMI-based Clustering              | A clustering method that groups reads based on their associated UMIs. UMI-based clustering with positional clustering ensures that reads originating from the exact same original molecule are clustered together. This is crucial for consensus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Cluster Size                      | The number of reads in a cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Effective Cluster Size            | Average read support per consensus position (total bases in consensus matrix / covered positions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Decoding                          | The process of computationally separating a duplex sequencing read into its two constituent single-strand reads (R1 and R2). This is a preparatory step for building a highly accurate consensus sequence by allowing the tool to compare the two complementary strands originating from the same original DNA molecule.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Parent-parent                     | A specific workflow typically used for linear amplification protocols (without PCR duplicates). In this mode, both the R1 and R2 strands of a duplex read are considered original "parent" molecules. This approach provides ultra-high accuracy for consensus calling by allowing the correction of strand-specific sequencing errors and chemical damage artifacts by comparing the two independent strands.                                                                                 |
| Parent-daughter                   | A specific workflow used for data that has undergone PCR amplification. In this mode, the two strands of a duplex read (R1 and R2) are not always derived from the two original complementary strands. Instead, they can be PCR copies of the same strand, making the data effectively "pseudo-duplex." This approach informs consensus calling by grouping reads based on this relationship, although it does not provide the same level of error correction as a true parent-parent workflow. |
| Hairpin duplex read               | A read that contains both strands of the same DNA molecule (R1 and R2) connected by a hairpin adapter. After sequencing, a consensus is computed from R1 and R2 to produce a higher-accuracy sequence. They can be broken into the two constituent reads during consensus generation.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Super Region                      | Large, non-overlapping genomic segments into which the input BAM data is partitioned. These super regions are processed independently and in parallel by Read Collapser to improve performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Wiggle Room                       | A configurable parameter that defines a positional tolerance or allowance for minor variations in read alignment coordinates (start and end positions) when performing positional clustering. This helps to group reads that are biologically duplicates but have slight alignment differences.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Partial Reads                     | Reads with an incomplete insert. They can be either 5' partial (truncated on the 5' end) or 3' partial (truncated on the 3' end). Read Collapser can specifically handle these reads during clustering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Full Reads                        | Reads with a complete insert.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Mean Base Quality                 | The average quality score of all bases within a sequencing read. In duplicate marking, the read with the highest mean base quality within a cluster is typically selected as the non-duplicate representative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Taskflow                          | A C++ library used by Read Collapser to efficiently manage and execute parallel tasks across multiple CPU cores, particularly for processing large genomic regions (super regions) concurrently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| BAM File                          | Binary Alignment/Map format; a compressed binary representation of sequence alignment data, containing reads aligned to a reference genome. Read Collapser takes position-sorted BAM files as input.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| BAI File                          | BAM Index file; an index file for a BAM file, which allows fast retrieval of reads from specific genomic regions without having to scan the entire BAM file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| BED File                          | Browser Extensible Data format; a plain text file format used to define genomic regions (e.g., target regions for sequencing). Read Collapser can use a BED file to focus processing on specific regions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Phred Score                       | A logarithmic measure of the probability of an incorrect base call in sequencing data. Higher Phred scores indicate higher base call accuracy. Quality scores in FASTQ files are often encoded using Phred scores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
