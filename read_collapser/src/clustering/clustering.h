/**
 * Cluster reads based on their alignment start and end positions and strand information.
 * If cluster_by_umi is enabled, the reads are first clustered by UMI and then by position.
 * This clustering method allows for something we call "drift" which is something we have observed where reads from the
 * same cluster can have slightly different start and end positions. To address this we allow for a "wiggle room" and
 * further reads are added to the cluster in recursive manner within the wiggle room threshold.
 *
 * Full reads are first clustered by position using wiggle_room. Partial reads (IsFivePrimeComplete/
 * IsThreePrimeComplete) are then assigned to the nearest full-read cluster within
 * wiggle_room_partial. Remaining unassigned partial reads are optionally clustered into partial-only
 * clusters if make_clusters_of_partial_reads_only is enabled.
 *
 * @param [in] options ReadCollapserOptions containing wiggle_room, wiggle_room_partial, cluster_by_strand,
 * exclude_partial_reads, and make_clusters_of_partial_reads_only parameters.
 * @param [in] create_cluster_id A function that produces a unique cluster id on each invocation.
 * @param [in] reads The reads to cluster. Note that this is a const reference to a vector of AlignmentPtrs,
 * but the alignments themselves are modified by assigning cluster information to them.
 * @param [out] clusters The clusters produced by clustering the reads.
