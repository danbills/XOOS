/**
 * @class DFAClassifier
 * @brief  This is a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)-based sequence classifier, which is designed to efficiently
 * classify sequences based on a single reference pattern (e.g., adapter stem), for seed-and-extend approaches.
 *
 * This is originally intended when we know the start of where the match should be. Matching ends when we reach the end
 * of the reference sequence not penalizing for trailing insertions or even missing sequence entirely with k-mer based
 * methods (because of truncated sequence).
 *
 * Unlike purely Levenshtein-based approaches, such as Myers' Bit-Vector Algorithm, this DFA-based classifier can
 * incorporate more complex heuristics and scoring schemes, such as different penalties for insertions, deletions, and
 * substitutions. This allows for a more nuanced classification that can better reflect the biological realities of
 * sequencing errors and variations. The downside is that the DFA can grow exponentially with the length of the
 * reference sequence, so it is important to optimize the construction and prune the state space effectively.
 *
 * Technically we are performing "Powerset Construction" of an NFA to a DFA, but we can optimize by bypassing the
 * explicit NFA construction. We do this by directly building the DFA states and transitions based on the reference
 * sequence and the defined scoring scheme for matches, insertions, substitutions, and deletions
 *
 * The classifier uses log odds values for scoring matches, insertions, substitutions, and deletions. These values are
 * additive for fast computation and can be tuned based on empirical data to reflect the likelihood of different types
 * of errors in the sequencing process. Analogous to scoring and will not be a true probability, but a log odds score
 * that can be used for classification thresholds. Could be calibrated to actual probabilities if we ever want that.
 *
 * Pruning during construction:
 * - NFA superposition width limit (max_drop_difference): during powerset construction, each NFA superposition
 *   vector is normalized so the peak position has score 0. Individual NFA positions whose normalized score falls
 *   below -max_drop_difference are pruned. This controls the number of distinct DFA states (memory) and limits
 *   the error patterns the DFA can represent. For example, max_drop_difference=10 allows up to 2 consecutive
 *   deletions (2 * |kDeletion| = 10) within a single alignment step to survive.
 *   Note: Due to the insertion self-loops (the peak position can always absorb an input base via insertion at
 *   cost kInsertion, which after normalization can never exceed -|kMatch - kInsertion| = -5), so we technically can't
 *   ever end on these nodes in a fully pruned state in the graph.
 *
 * - Banded alignment depth limit (max_band_size): During powerset construction, the BFS depth of each state
 *   is tracked (depth = minimum number of input bases consumed to reach it). The maximum allowed depth is
 *   ref_len + max_band_size, analogous to banded Smith-Waterman where the alignment can deviate at most
 *   max_band_size positions from the diagonal. Any transition that would create a state beyond this depth
 *   is wired to kPruneTermination instead. This bounds the DFA size and produces structural dead-ends
 *   that terminate classification when too many input bases are consumed without completing the reference.
 *
 * Pruning during classification (runtime):
 * - Runtime X-drop in Classify: when the cumulative score drops more than a caller-specified threshold below the
 *   peak score observed so far, the walk terminates early with kFoundPruned. This is the BLAST-style X-drop and
 *   is the primary mechanism for stopping once the alignment has clearly moved past the adapter region.

  /**
   * Constructs the DFA classifier with the given reference pattern.
   *
   * We construct the DFA by directly building the states and transitions based on the reference sequence.
   * When direction is kBackward the reference is reversed internally so that Classify iterates the input
   * sequence in reverse, producing biologically meaningful results without the caller needing to reverse anything.
   *
   * The max_drop_difference controls the width of the NFA superposition during powerset construction. The NFA
   * superposition is a vector of scores representing the best log-odds score to reach each position in the reference at
   * a given point in the input sequence. After each AdvanceNfa step, the superposition is normalized so the peak
   * position has score 0. Any NFA position whose normalized score falls below -max_drop_difference is pruned from the
   * superposition.
   *
   * Banded alignment width determines how far out indels can go out to. For example, to tolerate 2 consecutive
   * deletions in an alignment, this must be >= 2 * |kDeletion| = 10. The DFA will allow at most ref_len + max_band_size
   * input bases before pruning.
