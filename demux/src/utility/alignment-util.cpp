/**
 * @brief Tries to left-align the indels in the alignment.
 *
 * This algorithm does not change the consensus sequence. It works by iterating over the alignment backwards
 * and moving the indel to the left if it does not cause a mismatch. This algorithm assumes Levenshtein distance
 * (edit distance mismatches, insertions, and deletions are all equal). It would not work properly if we use
 * something that has gap penalties. This works over the entire consensus region, including the adapter trimmed region.
 * Thus, it is possible to move indels into the end adapter trimmed region (effectively removing indels from the read).
 *
 * This function does not move indels in a way that will allow for gap openings to occur, which means that for
 * groups of colliding indels it is possible to collapse gaps together. This is probably desirable behavior as errors
 * are often clustered together in the same region.
 *
 * @param consensus The consensus sequence. Only the duplex region.
 * @param alignment The alignment data to be modified. Must be at least as long as the consensus.
