 * A struct to hold coverage histograms for a dataset.
 *
 * If the dataset is duplex, it will contain two histograms:
 * - full_coverage_histogram: for all bases (including low-quality discordant duplex bases and simplex bases)
 * - concordant_duplex_coverage_histogram: for post-filter concordant duplex bases
 *
 * Otherwise, it will only contain the full_coverage_histogram for all bases.
 *
 * It contains a summary of coverage statistics with basic information like min, max, mean, median,
 * and percentiles. It also contains a summary of the coverage distribution, which includes information on
 * the number and percentage of positions have coverage at least a certain cutoff.
