 * @brief Statistics for a particular homopolymer region of a specific base and length.
 *
 * Tracks comprehensive error and coverage statistics for homopolymer sequences (e.g., AAAA, GGGGG).
 * Each HpStat instance represents a specific homopolymer type defined by its base (A/C/G/T) and length.
 * The struct maintains various coverage metrics (total, spanning, effective) and error counts (insertions,
 * deletions, substitutions) aggregated across all reads that align to homopolymers of this type.
 * Position-specific error tracking allows detailed analysis of where errors occur within the homopolymer.
 * This is stored on the first position of the homopolymer in the reference.
