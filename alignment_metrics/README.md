# Alignment Metrics

## Getting started

### Introduction

The Alignment Metrics Tools can be used to assess sequencing data quality and coverage.
It provides metrics for read-level statistics, accuracy, and coverage including error and coverage statistics for
homopolymer regions,
which makes it suitable for both quality control and analysis of sequencing data.

It can be used with various SBX chemistries, including duplex (SBX-D and SBX-Fast) and simplex (SBX-S).
It supports both demuxed and post-consensus aligned reads.

The Alignment Metrics tool can produce the following 3 categories of metrics:

- Read Metrics: Metrics on the number of reads and alignments (including count of mapped, duplicate, secondary,
  supplementary alignments, and unmapped reads) as well as read length distribution.
  - (optional) Targeted Enrichment Read Metrics: For targeted enrichment datasets, additional metrics on
    the number of on-target reads and alignments are provided.
- Coverage: Metrics on the depth of coverage. For duplex datasets, metrics on the concordant duplex
  coverage are also provided.
  - (optional) Homopolymer Coverage: Coverage metrics for regions of the reference that are homopolymers.
  - (optional) Coverage Uniformity: For targeted enrichment datasets, additional metrics on the
    coverage uniformity across target regions are provided.
- Accuracy: Accuracy and error rates at the base level, including error rates for substitutions, insertions, and
  deletions.
  For intermolecular consensus data, additional metrics on the base-level accuracy categorized by the
  size and type of the read cluster from which the consensus read was generated are provided.
  - (optional) Homopolymer Accuracy: Accuracy metrics for regions of the reference that are homopolymers.

The tool can optionally identify homopolymer regions from reference regions and calculate the coverage and accuracy
metrics for those regions.
These are particularly useful for assessing the quality of sequencing data in homopolymer regions.

The overall workflow of the Alignment Metrics tool is summarized in the following diagram:

### Recommended system requirements

|        | Requirements                                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU    | Utilization scales well up to 8 cores on a modern (4th Gen Intel Xeon or 4th Gen AMD EPYC) CPU |
| Memory | At least 16 GiB with 8 threads, memory usage scales with region size and coverage depth      |

## Usage

Alignment Metrics can compute each type of the metrics outlined in the [Introduction](#introduction) individually or
perform a full analysis that includes all metrics.

### Coverage Metrics Usage

#### Coverage Metrics Example Command

If you do not need coverage metrics for homopolymer regions, you can run the following command to compute coverage
metrics.

```bash
alignment_metrics coverage \
  --bam-input INPUT.bam \
  --bed-input TARGET.bed \
  --output-dir /PATH/TO/OUTPUT_DIR \
  --threads 8
```

If you need coverage metrics for homopolymer regions, simply add the `--enable-hp-metrics` flag to the command.

```bash
alignment_metrics coverage \
  --bam-input INPUT.bam \
  --bed-input TARGET.bed \
  --output-dir /PATH/TO/OUTPUT_DIR \
  --enable-hp-metrics \
  --threads 8
```

To calculate coverage for duplex dataset (SBX-D or SBX-FAST), set the `--min-base-type` flag to `concordant` to filter out simplex and discordant duplex bases.

```bash
alignment_metrics coverage \
  --bam-input INPUT.bam \
  --bed-input TARGET.bed \
  --output-dir /PATH/TO/OUTPUT_DIR \
  --min-base-type concordant \
  --threads 8
```

#### Coverage Metrics Input

- Position sorted BAM file with an associated index file (`.bai`)
- Optional BED file to specify regions of interest (e.g., for TE samples or high-confidence regions)
- Reference FASTA file with an associated index file (`.fai`) if homopolymer coverage is requested

#### Coverage Metrics Output

Coverage metrics are written to a directory named `coverage` under the specified output directory.

| Output Name                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| coverage_histograms.tsv           | A histogram where the bins are depths of coverage and the values in each bin are the number of positions with the given coverage. For duplex datasets, the histogram contains two columns, one for overall coverage and one for concordant duplex coverage.                                                 |
| coverage_stats.tsv                | Summary information about the coverage, including mean, median, and percentiles. An additional column with summary information on concordant duplex coverage is produced for duplex datasets.                                                                                                              |
| coverage_distribution_summary.tsv | Summary information describing the number of positions with coverage greater than or equal to a set of cutoff thresholds, as well as the total number of positions with and without coverage. An additional column with summary information on concordant duplex coverage is produced for duplex datasets. |

If `--enable-hp-metrics` is specified, the same metrics described above are also generated for homopolymer regions,
resulting in the following additional files:

- `coverage_histograms_hp.tsv`: A histogram of coverage depths for homopolymer regions.
- `coverage_stats_hp.tsv`: Summary statistics for coverage in homopolymer regions.
- `coverage_distribution_summary_hp.tsv`: Summary information about the number of positions with coverage greater than
  or equal to a set of cutoff thresholds in homopolymer regions.

If `--enable-te-metrics` is enabled, these two additional files are generated:

| Output Name                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mean_coverage_histogram.tsv     | A histogram where the bins are mean coverage values and the values in each bin are the number of target regions with the given mean coverage. This histogram can be used to assess the overall coverage distribution across target regions and coverage uniformity. |
| coverage_uniformity_summary.tsv | Summary information describing the coverage uniformity across target regions, including metrics like the fold-80 base penalty, positions with 0.5x-2x mean coverage.                                                                                                |

#### Coverage Metrics Definitions

Note: Unless otherwise specified, metrics in this section only consider reads that intersect with regions in the provided BED file (if any) and pass the read-level filters (`min-mapq` and `exclude-flags`).
Moreover, only positions that are part of the regions specified in the provided BED file (if any) are considered when calculating coverage histogram.

##### coverage_histograms.tsv

This file contains a histogram of coverage depths, with the following columns:

duplex (SBX-D or SBX-FAST) datasets

```text
coverage    position_count    post_filter_position_count    concordant_duplex_position_count
```

non-duplex datasets

```text
coverage    position_count    post_filter_position_count
```

Note that `concordant_duplex_position_count` is only present for duplex datasets.
Post-filter position count is present for both duplex and non-duplex datasets, representing the number of positions that pass user-specified base-level filters (`min-baseq` and `min-base-type`) at the given coverage depth.

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| median                  | Median coverage (or median concordant duplex coverage for the `concordant_duplex_coverage` column, median coverage after filtering by user-specified `min-baseq` and `min-base-type` for the `post_filter_coverage` column)                                                       |
| mean                    | Mean coverage (or mean concordant duplex coverage for the `concordant_duplex_coverage` column, mean coverage after filtering by user-specified `min-baseq` and `min-base-type` for the `post_filter_coverage` column)                                                             |
| min                     | Minimum coverage (or minimum concordant duplex coverage for the `concordant_duplex_coverage` column, minimum coverage after filtering by user-specified `min-baseq` and `min-base-type` for the `post_filter_coverage` column)                                                    |
| max                     | Maximum coverage (or maximum concordant duplex coverage for the `concordant_duplex_coverage` column, maximum coverage after filtering by user-specified `min-baseq` and `min-base-type` for the `post_filter_coverage` column)                                                    |
| percentile_X            | The coverage (or concordant duplex coverage for the `concordant_duplex_coverage` column, coverage after filtering by user-specified `min-baseq` and `min-base-type` for the `post_filter_coverage` column) such that X% of all positions have a coverage less than or equal to it |
| ratio_X_to_Y_percentile | The ratio of the Xth percentile to the Yth percentile coverage (or concordant duplex coverage for the `concordant_duplex_coverage` column, minimum coverage after filtering by user-specified `min-baseq` and `min-base-type` for the `post_filter_coverage` column)              |

Notes:

- `concordant_duplex_coverage` is only present for duplex datasets.
- `post_filter_coverage` is the coverage after filtering out bases that do not pass the base-level filtering (base quality and base type filters).
- Zero coverage positions are excluded from the calculation of mean, median, percentiles, and ratio metrics if no BED file is provided.
  This is because without a BED file, the presence of alt and decoy contigs in the reference can lead to misleading coverage statistics.
- If all positions have zero coverage (e.g. if all bases are filtered out), the summary will contain "NA" for all metrics when no BED file is provided, or "0" when a BED file is provided.

##### coverage_distribution_summary.tsv

This file contains summary information about the number of positions with coverage greater than or equal to a set of
cutoff thresholds, as well as the total number of positions with and without coverage, with the following columns:

duplex (SBX-D or SBX-FAST) datasets

```text
metric_name   any_coverage    post_filter_coverage    concordant_duplex_coverage
```

non-duplex datasets

```text
metric_name   any_coverage    post_filter_coverage
```

Notes:

- `concordant_duplex_coverage` is only present for duplex datasets.
- `post_filter_coverage` is the coverage after filtering out bases that do not pass the base-level filtering (base quality and base type filters).

### Accuracy Metrics Usage

#### Accuracy Metrics Example Command

If you do not need accuracy metrics for homopolymer regions, you can run the following command to compute accuracy
metrics.

```bash
alignment_metrics accuracy \
  --bam-input INPUT.bam \
  --bed-input TARGET.bed \
  --reference REFERENCE_GENOME.fa \
  --output-dir /PATH/TO/OUTPUT_DIR \
  --threads 8
```

If you need accuracy metrics for homopolymer regions, simply add the `--enable-hp-metrics` flag to the command.

```bash
alignment_metrics accuracy \
  --bam-input INPUT.bam \
  --bed-input TARGET.bed \
  --reference REFERENCE_GENOME.fa \
  --output-dir /PATH/TO/OUTPUT_DIR \
  --enable-hp-metrics \
  --threads 8
```

To calculate accuracy for duplex dataset (SBX-D or SBX-FAST), set the `--min-base-type` flag to `concordant` to filter out simplex and discordant duplex bases.

```bash
alignment_metrics accuracy \
  --bam-input INPUT.bam \
  --bed-input TARGET.bed \
  --reference REFERENCE_GENOME.fa \
  --output-dir /PATH/TO/OUTPUT_DIR \
  --min-base-type concordant \
  --threads 8
```

#### Accuracy Metrics Input

- Position sorted BAM file with an associated index file (`.bai`)
- Optional BED file to specify regions of interest (e.g., for TE samples or high-confidence regions)
- Reference FASTA file with an associated index file (`.fai`)

#### Accuracy Metrics Output

Accuracy metrics are written to a directory named `accuracy` under the specified output directory.

The following metrics are generated for all datasets.

| Output Name                     | Description                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| base_level_accuracy_summary.tsv | Total count of errors of each type (substitution, insertion, and deletion) and their corresponding Phred scores.                        |
| errors_by_substitution_type.tsv | Total count of substitution errors categorized by the type of substitution and the read type (forward/reverse, full/partial).           |

For datasets that has read type (partial/full) and/or strand information (forward/reverse), the following additional metrics are generated:

| Output Name                     | Description                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| errors_by_read_type.tsv         | Total count of errors of each type (substitution, insertion, and deletion) categorized by the read type (forward/reverse, full/partial) |

Note: `errors_by_read_type` is not produced for intermolecular consensus data because intermolecular consensus datasets contains consensus reads that no longer have individual read type or strand information.
The error counts for intermolecular consensus reads are instead categorized by the cluster type information in the `errors_by_cluster_size.tsv` file.
Additionally, error counts by partial/full read type are not applicable for duplex datasets, as partial-length duplex reads are always discarded during demultiplexing.

For intermolecular consensus datasets (produced by Read Collapser consensus and re-aligned to the reference), the following additional metrics are generated:

| Output Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| errors_by_cluster_size.tsv | Total count of errors of each type (substitution, insertion, and deletion) categorized by the size and characteristics of the read cluster used to generate the consensus read. |

If `--enable-hp-metrics` is specified, the following additional metrics are generated for homopolymer regions:

| Output Name   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| hp_errors.tsv | Counts of reads supporting each type of homopolymer and the number of homopolymer spanning reads that have errors categorized by the type of homopolymer (base and length) and the error type (substitution, insertion, deletion). |

#### Accuracy Metrics Definitions

Note: Unless otherwise specified, metrics in this section only consider bases that:

- intersect with regions in the provided BED file (if any)
- are from reads that pass the read-level filters (`min-mapq` and `exclude-flags`)
- pass the base-level filters (`min-baseq` and `min-base-type`).

##### base_level_accuracy_summary.tsv

This file contains the total count of errors of each type (substitution, insertion, and deletion) and their
corresponding Phred quality scores.
The columns in this file are as follows:

```text
type    count    denominator    phred    percentage
```

where `type` is one of the following: `total_aligned_bases`, `substitutions`, `insertion_events`, `inserted_bases`, `deletion_events`, `deleted_bases`, `indel_events`, `indel_bases`, `all_errors_with_indel_events`, or `all_errors_with_indel_bases`.

`denominator` specifies the denominator used to calculate the percentage and Phred-scale accuracy for each error type.

| Metric name                  | Definition                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| total_aligned_bases          | Total number of aligned bases                                                                  |
| substitutions                | Total number of substitution errors                                                            |
| insertion_events             | Total number of insertion events (a continuous stretch of inserted bases counted as one event) |
| inserted_bases               | Total number of inserted bases (each inserted base counted individually)                       |
| deletion_events              | Total number of deletion events (a continuous stretch of deleted bases counted as one event)   |
| deleted_bases                | Total number of deleted bases (each deleted base counted individually)                         |
| indel_events                 | The sum of total insertion and total deletion events                                           |
| indel_bases                  | The sum of total inserted and total deleted bases                                              |
| all_errors_with_indel_events | The sum of substitutions and indel events                                                      |
| all_errors_with_indel_bases  | The sum of substitutions and indel bases                                                       |

For `insertion_events`, `deletion_events`, and `indel_events`, insertions and deletions of any length are each counted as a single event,
whereas for `inserted_bases`, `deleted_bases`, and `indel_bases`, each base involved in an insertion or deletion is counted as a separate error.

The tool does not distinguish between `substitution_bases` and `substitution_events` because each base mismatch (substitution) is considered an independent event.
In the metric output, there are two duplicate rows for `substitutions`, one with `denominator` as `total_aligned_bases + indel_events` and the other with `denominator` as `total_aligned_bases + indel_bases`.
The two rows have identical `count`s, but the `percentage` and `phred` values differ slightly due to the different denominators used.

For each type of error, the Phred-scale accuracy is also provided, calculated as follows:

$$\min \{ 93, -10 \times \log_{10}\frac{\text{number of errors}}{\text{total bases + indels}} \}$$

Additionally, the output reports the total number of positions being considered for accuracy metrics, as well as positions skipped due to low depth
or high alt allele fraction (e.g. a potential variant site).

| Metric name                                       | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| positions_skipped_due_to_low_depth                | The total number of reference positions skipped due to low depth. The depth threshold is specified by `--min-depth`.                                                                                |
| positions_skipped_due_to_high_alt_allele_fraction | The total number of reference positions skipped due to high alt allele fraction (e.g. a potential variant site). The alt allele fraction threshold is specified by `--max-alt-allele-fraction`.     |

### Read Metrics Usage

#### Read Metrics Example Command

```bash
alignment_metrics read \
  --bam-input INPUT.bam \
  --bed-input TARGET.bed \
  --output-dir /PATH/TO/OUTPUT_DIR \
  --threads 8
```

#### Read Metrics Input

- Position sorted BAM file with an associated index file (`.bai`)
- Optional BED file to specify regions of interest (e.g., for TE samples or high-confidence regions)

#### Read Metrics Output

Read metrics are written to a directory named `read` under the specified output directory.

| Output Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| read_metrics_summary.tsv   | Counts and percentage of mapped, unmapped, duplicate, supplementary, secondary reads as well as reads with mapping quality 0 and reads that did not pass the quality filter.                                                                       |
| read_length_histograms.tsv | A histogram where the bins are read lengths and the values in each bin are the number of reads of that length. For datasets with read type information (full/partial), the number of full and partial reads for each histogram bin is also included. |
| read_length_summary.tsv    | Summary information about the read length, including mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles. Additional columns for the full and partial read lengths are produced for dataset with read type information (full/partial).               |

For intermolecular consensus datasets, the following additional metrics are generated:

| Output Name                     | Description                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| read_counts_by_cluster_size.tsv | The number of mapped reads passing filter categorized by the cluster size and cluster characteristics. |

If `--enable-te-metrics` is enabled, the following additional metric is generated:

| Output Name              | Description                                                                                     |

| read_metrics_te.tsv      | On target read and alignment counts and percentages for targeted enrichment datasets.           |

#### Read Metrics Definitions

Notes:

- Unless otherwise specified, metrics in this section only consider reads that intersect with regions in the provided BED file (if any).
If no BED file is provided, all reads in the BAM file are considered.
- Unlike coverage and accuracy metrics, base counts reported as part of read-level metrics are calculated based on the entire read, not just the portion that overlaps with the target region.
This means that bases that are outside the target region can be included in the base counts as long as they are part of a read that intersects with the target region.
- Base-level filters are not applied to read-level metrics.
Metrics such as `aligned_bases_passing_filter`, `soft_clipped_bases_passing_filter`, `gc_bases_passing_filter` refer to bases from reads that pass read-level filters, not base-level filters.
For detailed base-level metrics with base-level filter, use `base_level_accuracy_summary.tsv` from accuracy metrics.

##### read_metrics_summary.tsv

This file contains a summary of read counts and percentages for various read types.
The columns in this file are as follows:

```text
metric_name    count    denominator    percentage
```

Note: This metric file contains information on both alignments and reads. Alignments and reads are related but distinct concepts. See [here](#general-definitions) for more details.

The rows are the following metrics:

| Metric Name                       | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Denominator for percentage     |

- alignments_plus_unmapped_reads = total_reads + supplementary_alignments + secondary_alignments
- total_reads = mapped_reads + unmapped_reads
- total_reads = full_length_reads + partial_length_reads (if read type information is available)
- total_reads = full_cluster_reads + mixed_full_and_partial_cluster_reads + partial_cluster_reads (if cluster information is available)

##### read_metrics_te.tsv

This file contains read metrics specific to targeted enrichment (TE) datasets.

Notes:

- This metric file contains information on both alignments and reads. Alignments and reads are related but distinct concepts. See [here](#general-definitions) for more details.
- Unlike `read_metrics_summary.tsv` and other metrics files, which only consider reads that intersect with regions in the provided BED file (if any),
`total_mapped_alignments_in_bam` in `read_metrics_te.tsv` considers all mapped alignments in the BAM file, regardless of whether they intersect with the BED regions.
- `total_mapped_alignments_in_bam` is calculated from the BAM index and includes primary, secondary, and supplementary alignments. This can lead to a slightly lower on-target rate when compared to calculations based solely on primary alignments.

The columns in this file are as follows:

```text
metric_name    count    denominator    percentage
```

The rows are the following metrics:

| Metric Name                    | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Denominator for percentage     |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| total_mapped_alignments_in_bam | The total number of mapped [alignments](#general-definitions) in the BAM file. A read can have multiple alignment records associated with it.                                                                 | N/A                            |
| on_target_alignments           | The number of [alignments](#general-definitions) that intersect with at least one region in the provided BED file. This includes any supplementary and secondary alignments that align to the target regions. | total_mapped_alignments_in_bam |
| on_target_reads_passing_filter | The number of [reads](#general-definitions) that intersect with at least one region in the provided BED file and pass the read filters.                                                                       | total_mapped_alignments_in_bam |

`on_target_alignments` in this file equals the sum of `mapped_reads`, `secondary_alignments`, and `supplementary_alignments` from `read_metrics_summary.tsv`.

##### read_length_histograms.tsv

This file contains a histogram of read lengths, where the bins are read lengths and the values in each bin are the
number of reads of that length.
The columns in this file are as follows:

```text
read_length_excluding_soft_clipped_bases    post_filter_read_count    post_filter_full_read_count    post_filter_partial_read_count
```

defined as follows:

| Metric Name                              | Definition                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| read_length_excluding_soft_clipped_bases | The length of the read in bases excluding soft-clipped bases.                                        |
| post_filter_read_count                   | The number of mapped reads of the given length that passed the mapping quality and flag filters.     |
| post_filter_full_read_count              | The number of full mapped reads of the given length that passed mapping quality and flag filters.    |
| post_filter_partial_read_count           | The number of partial mapped reads of the given length that passed mapping quality and flag filters. |

Notes:

- `full_read_count` and `partial_read_count` columns are only present if the dataset has read type information (full/partial).
- Read length distribution and summary are calculated based on mapped primary alignments. Unmapped reads, secondary, and supplementary alignments are not included in read length metrics regardless of the filter settings.
- Unmapped reads are excluded from read length metrics because the reported length excludes soft-clipped bases, which is determined by the alignment and CIGAR string. Unmapped reads are not aligned and do not have CIGAR strings.
- Supplementary and secondary alignments are excluded from read-length metrics to avoid double counting since each read can have multiple secondary and supplementary alignment records.

Metrics in `read_length_histograms.tsv` satisfy the following constraint:

for each read length:

- post_filter_read_count = post_filter_full_read_count + post_filter_partial_read_count (if read type information is available)

##### read_length_summary.tsv

This file contains summary information about the read length, including mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles.

```text
metric_name    post_filter_read_length_excluding_soft_clipped_bases   post_filter_full_read_length_excluding_soft_clipped_bases   post_filter_partial_read_length_excluding_soft_clipped_bases
```

and the rows are the following metrics:

| Metric Name  | Definition                                                                                                |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mean         | The mean read length excluding soft-clipped bases (all reads/full reads/partial reads).                   |
| median       | The median read length excluding soft-clipped bases (all reads/full reads/partial reads).                 |

| percentile_X | The read length at the Xth percentile excluding soft-clipped bases (all reads/full reads/partial reads).  |

##### read_counts_by_cluster_size.tsv

This file contains the number of mapped reads passing filter categorized by the cluster size and cluster
characteristics.
The rows are the cluster sizes, up to the max cluster size specified in the command line, and the columns are as
follows:

| Metric Name                                         | Definition                                                                                                                   |

### All Metrics Usage

To compute all metrics, including coverage, accuracy, and read metrics, you can use the `all` command.

```bash
alignment_metrics all \
  --bam-input INPUT.bam \
  --reference REFERENCE_GENOME.fa \
  --bed-input TARGET.bed \
  --output-dir /PATH/TO/OUTPUT_DIR \
  --threads 8
```

If you also wish to include homopolymer accuracy and coverage metrics, you can add the `--enable-hp-metrics` flag.

```bash
alignment_metrics all \
  --bam-input INPUT.bam \
  --reference REFERENCE_GENOME.fa \
  --bed-input TARGET.bed \
  --output-dir /PATH/TO/OUTPUT_DIR \
  --enable-hp-metrics \
  --threads 8
```

For duplex datasets, set the `--min-base-type` flag to `concordant` to filter out simplex and discordant duplex bases.

```bash
alignment_metrics all \
  --bam-input INPUT.bam \
  --reference REFERENCE_GENOME.fa \
  --bed-input TARGET.bed \
  --output-dir /PATH/TO/OUTPUT_DIR \
  --min-base-type concordant \
  --threads 8
```

#### All Metrics Input

- Position sorted BAM file with an associated index file (`.bai`)
- Reference FASTA file with an associated index file (`.fai`)
- Optional BED file to specify regions of interest (e.g., for TE samples or high-confidence regions)

#### All Metrics Output

Metrics are written to their respective directories under the specified output directory. For more details on the output
files, see the sections on [Coverage Metrics](#coverage-metrics-usage), [Accuracy Metrics](#accuracy-metrics-usage),
and [Read Metrics](#read-metrics-usage).

## Overview and CLI options

### Design Summary

- A BAM file is taken as input, along with an optional BED file and a reference FASTA file.
- Large regions are partitioned into smaller regions while small regions that are close to or overlapping with each
  other are merged.
- Each thread processes a region, calculating metrics for each region. The calculated metrics are stored in a metrics
  container owned by the thread.
  - For each region, the reads overlapping with the region are fetched.
  - If homopolymer accuracy is requested, homopolymer regions in the reference are identified.
  - A pileup entry is created for each reference position in the region that is covered by a read. Information such as
      error count and depth of coverage is stored in the pileup entry.
  - The reads are processed in sorted order, and for each read, metrics are calculated based on the CIGAR string and
      the collected information is stored in the pileup entry.
  - Metrics are collected and pileup entries are erased once they are no longer needed.
- The per-thread metrics containers are merged into a final metrics container, which is used to produce the output
  files.

This describes the high-level algorithm used to generate the metrics.

![Algorithm overview](docs/assets/per-thread-metrics-worker.svg)

Each thread is associated with a metrics worker that processes super regions assigned to it.
The metrics worker fetches reads overlapping with the sub-regions within the super region and processes each read to
update the metrics.

Each metrics worker has its own metrics container to store the metrics calculated for the regions it processes.
The per-thread metrics are merged into the final metrics at the end.

#### Discordant Homopolymer Masking in Duplex Reads

By default, when extracting qualities from regions in duplex reads, the tool looks for homopolymers within the individual reads
and sets the quality to discordant if any of the bases within the homopolymer is discordant.
These modified duplex base types are used for calculating accuracy metrics.
This behavior can be disabled with a flag or if the read is not a duplex read.

##### Input Options for All Subcommands

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Value(s)                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **-b/--bam-input** | Path to the BAM file which the metrics are to be calculated. The BAM file must be coordinate-sorted and indexed.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Path to a sorted and indexed BAM file   |
| -i/--bed-input     | Path to a BED file which specifies regions of interest for the metrics calculation. If specified, only reads overlapping with a region of interest and positions contained within a region of interest will contribute to the metrics. If not specified, all contigs present in the BAM header will contribute to the metrics. | Path to a BED file or empty if not used |

##### Additional Input Options for Accuracy and Coverage Metrics

| Parameter                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Value(s)                                |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|

Note: `--reference` is only required for accuracy and homopolymer coverage metrics. If only overall coverage metrics are
needed, it can be omitted.

#### Output Options

| Parameter    | Description                                                        | Value(s)                            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| --output-dir | Path to the output directory where the metrics will be written to. | Path to a directory. [default: `.`] |

#### Read-level Filter Options

The following parameters are used to filter reads based on their mapping quality and flags.
Reads that do not pass these filters will not contribute to the coverage metrics, accuracy metrics, and post-filter read
metrics (e.g. `reads_passing_filter`, etc.). These filters are not applied for read-level metrics that are calculated before filtering such as `total_reads`.

| Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Value(s)                                                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -e/--exclude-flags | Exclude alignments from coverage metrics, accuracy metrics, and post-filter read metrics if any bits in their FLAG field match the specified decimal integer. Refer to <https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html> for flag generation. | Integer [default: 3332, i.e. supplementary, secondary, unmapped, and duplicate] |
| -Q/--min-mapq      | Minimum mapping quality. Reads with a mapping quality less than the threshold are not considered for coverage metrics, accuracy metrics, and post-filter read metrics.                                                                                   | Integer from 0 to 255 [default: 4]                                              |

#### Read Trimming Options

Alignment Metrics allows trimming of bases from the start and/or end of each read before calculating metrics.

Bases trimmed from the read will not contribute to coverage metrics, accuracy metrics, and read length metrics.
Trimming can cause some reads to have zero length after trimming; such reads will be excluded from all metrics calculations.
Additionally, if trimming results in a read alignment that no longer overlaps with a region of interest specified in the BED file,
that read will be excluded from all metrics calculations.

| Parameter             | Description                                          | Value(s)                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| --trim-leading-bases  | Number of bases to trim from the start of each read. | Integer from 0 to 50 [default: 0] |
| --trim-trailing-bases | Number of bases to trim from the end of each read.   | Integer from 0 to 50 [default: 0] |

#### Base-level Filter Options

The following parameters are used to filter bases based on their quality and depth. Bases that do not pass these filters
will not contribute to accuracy metrics and post-filter coverage metrics, but they still contribute to overall coverage and read metrics.

| Parameter                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Value(s)                                                        |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| -q/--min-baseq               | Minimum base quality. Bases with a base quality less than the threshold are not considered for accuracy and post-filter coverage metrics.                                                                                    | Integer from 0 to 255 [default: 30]                              |
| --min-base-type              | Minimum duplex base type. For duplex datasets, bases with a base type worse than the threshold are not considered for accuracy and post-filter coverage metrics. For simplex datasets, it must always be set to `simplex`. | One of `{discordant, simplex, concordant}` [default: `simplex`] |
| --disable-base-type-decoding | Skip decoding of duplex base types from YC tags in the BAM file. When this flag is set, all bases are treated as simplex bases.                                                                                              | Flag [default: false]                                           |

The base type filter and base quality filter work conjunctively.
A base passes base-level filter only if it passes both base type and base quality filters.
Base types are not numeric values but they do have an intrinsic ordering. Concordant duplex bases are more reliable than simplex bases, and simplex bases are more reliable than discordant duplex bases (so `discordant < simplex < concordant`). See [Definitions for Duplex Reads](#definitions-for-duplex-reads) for more details.
A base passes the base type filter if it has a base type "at least as good as" (i.e. greater than or equal) the specified threshold.

The [YC tag](#definitions-for-duplex-reads) is a BAM tag that encodes the base type information for duplex reads.
If the BAM file does not contain YC tags, all bases will be treated as simplex bases.
If you wish to fully disable filtering by base type and YC tag decoding, set the flag `--disable-base-type-decoding` to treat all bases as simplex bases.
This will effectively disable base type filtering with the default `--min-base-type simplex` setting.

When `--disable-base-type-decoding` is set, `--min-base-type` cannot be set to `concordant` because all bases will be treated as simplex bases and no bases will pass the filter.

#### Coverage Metrics Options

The following options are used to control the calculation of coverage metrics and are only applicable for the `coverage`
and `all` subcommands.

| Parameter                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Value(s)                                    |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| --coverage-cutoffs            | A list of cutoff coverage values to be included in the coverage distribution summary metric.                                                                                                                                      | List of integers >= 0 [default: [10,20,30]] |
| --exclude-uncovered-positions | Exclude positions with no coverage when calculating coverage metrics and histograms. If this flag is turned on, the 0 bin in coverage histogram will only include reference positions where all supporting reads have a deletion. | Flag [default: false]                       |
| --max-coverage-bin            | Maximum coverage for coverage histograms. Positions with depth greater than the threshold will only contribute to the `max-coverage+` bin.                                                                                        | Integer > 0 [default 10000]                 |

#### Accuracy Metrics Options

The following options are used to control the calculation of accuracy metrics and are only applicable for the `accuracy`
and `all` subcommands.

| Parameter                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Value(s)                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| --min-depth               | Minimum depth. Positions with a total depth below the threshold do not contribute to accuracy metrics. For HP metrics, positions with depth less than the threshold are not filtered out but are not considered for alt allele fraction filter. | Integer >= 0 [default: 10] |
| --max-alt-allele-fraction | Maximum alt allele fraction to consider an error a sequencing error instead of a germline variant. For each position, errors with an alt allele fraction greater than the threshold at a given position do not contribute to accuracy metrics.  | Float [default: 0.1]       |
| --max-cluster-size-bin    | Maximum cluster size for computing errors by cluster size. Errors originating in a consensus read generated from a cluster of size larger than the threshold will be put into the `max-cluster-size+` bin.                                      | Integer > 0 [default 50]   |

| --min-hp-length                     | Minimum homopolymer length to consider for homopolymer metrics.                                                                 | Integer from 2 to 30 [default: 2]               |
| --max-hp-length                     | Maximum homopolymer length to consider for homopolymer metrics.                                                                 | Integer from `min-hp-length` to 30 [default 30] |
| --hp-allow-heterogeneous-insertions | Allow insertions that are heterogeneous (e.g. an insertion of T into an AAAAAA homopolymer) when evaluating homopolymer errors. | Flag [default: false]                           |
| --hp-subsampling-fraction           | Consider only a specified fraction of all reference homopolymer regions to reduce runtime and memory usage.                     | Float between 0 and 1 [default: 1.0]            |
| --hp-subsampling-seed               | The seed used for subsampling homopolymer regions.                                                                              | Integer                                         |

#### Target Enrichment Metrics Options

The following options are used to control the calculation of target enrichment metrics (read-level and coverage). They are only applicable for the `coverage`, `read`, and `all` subcommands.

| Parameter              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Value(s)                           |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| --enable-te-metrics    | Enable calculation of target enrichment metrics. Requires a BED file specifying target regions. When enabled, region partitioning is disabled and positions with no coverage are included when calculating coverage statistics.  | Flag [default: false]              |

Note: To accurately count the number of target regions and calculate the mean coverage per target region, `--enable-te-metrics` disables region partitioning.
This can lead to increased memory usage if the target regions are large. You will receive a warning if any region exceeds the recommended maximum region size of 2 million bases.
This shouldn't be an issue for most target panels. If you receive this warning, please double-check that the provided BED file is indeed a target panel BED file.

#### Read Metrics Options

The following options are used to control the calculation of read metrics and are only applicable for the `read` and
`all` subcommands.

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                                         | Value(s)                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| --max-read-length-bin | Maximum read length for read length histograms. Reads longer than the threshold will only contribute to the `max-read-length+` bin. | Integer > 0 [default: 1000] |

#### Summary Statistics Options

The following options are used to control the calculation of summary statistics, so they are only applicable to
subcommands that also produce histogram outputs (i.e. `coverage`, `read`, and `all`).

| Parameter                   | Description                                                                       | Value(s)                                             |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| --summary-stats-percentiles | A list of percentiles to compute for coverage and read length summary statistics. | List of integers > 0 [default: [10, 25, 50, 75, 90]] |

#### Performance Parameters

These parameters are used to control the performance of the tool, such as the number of threads used and the size of
regions processed.

| Parameter           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    | Value(s)                                                       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| --region-size       | The size of each region that are processed in parallel.                                                                                                                                        | Integer > 0 [default: 10000]                                   |
| --threads           | The number of threads used to compute metrics.                                                                                                                                                 | Integer from 1 to the number of threads available [default: 1] |
| --reference-padding | The number of extra reference bases to fetch on the 3' side of the region. This is to ensure all alignments that are fetched have the necessary context even if they extend beyond the region. | Integer >= 0 [default 1000]                                    |

#### Discordant Homopolymer Masking Options

By default, when extracting base qualities and base types from a read, the tool looks for homopolymers within the read and sets the quality to discordant if any of the bases within the homopolymer is discordant.
These modified duplex base types and qualities are used for calculating accuracy metrics and post-filter coverage metrics.
If a read is a duplex read with YC tag, the YC tag is used to identify discordant duplex bases unless `--disable-base-type-decoding` is enabled. If the read does not have a YC tag (e.g. is a simplex read or intermolecular consensus read), a base is considered discordant if the base quality is less than or equal to 5.

The following options are used to control the behavior of discordant homopolymer masking and are only applicable for the
`coverage`, `accuracy`, and `all` subcommands.

| Parameter                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                         | Value(s)                           |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| --disable-discordant-hp-masking | Disable discordant homopolymer masking in duplex reads. When enabled, bases within homopolymers are considered discordant if any of the bases within the homopolymer is discordant. | Flag [default: false]              |
| --min-baseq-for-hp-masking      | Base quality threshold for masking homopolymers for non-duplex dataset or when `--disable-base-type-decoding` is set                                                                | Integer from 0 to 255 [default: 5] |

| Crashing due to excessive memory usage                                            | The Alignment Metrics tool processes metrics by region. It can crash with a `std::bad_alloc` error message if the region size is too large and exceeds the available memory.                                                                                                                                                                                | Consider reducing the region size with the `--region-size` option or increasing the available memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Crashing due to excessive memory usage when calculating target enrichment metrics | When calculating target enrichment metrics, region partitioning is disabled to ensure accurate counting of target regions and mean coverage per target region. Large regions in the BED file are not partitioned even if they exceed the region size. This can lead to high memory usage if the target regions are large.                                   | Ensure that the provided BED file is indeed a target panel BED file as regions in a typical target panel BED file are expected to be small and well-defined. If the target regions are large, consider running the tool with fewer threads or increasing the available memory. You can also manually partition the large target region into smaller regions by editing the BED file, but note that this can affect the accuracy of the target enrichment metrics. |
| Post-filter coverage is higher than concordant duplex coverage for duplex reads   | A common misconception is that post-filter coverage implies high-quality coverage. This is not necessarily true, as post-filter coverage simply refers to the coverage after applying base-level filters (base quality and base type filters).                                                                                                              | Check `--min-base-type` and `--min-baseq` settings. The recommended `min-base-type` is `concordant` and the recommended `min-baseq` is 38 for duplex datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Post-filter coverage is 0 or N/A                                                  | For simplex datasets and intermolecular consensus datasets, all bases are considered simplex bases. If the dataset is duplex but does not have a YC tag, all bases will also be treated as simplex bases. In these cases, if `--min-base-type` is set to `concordant`, no bases will pass the base type filter, resulting in 0 or N/A post-filter coverage. | For simplex datasets, intermolecular consensus datasets, and any dataset without YC tags, set `--min-base-type` to `simplex`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Crashing due to malformed YC tag in BAM record                                    | If a BAM record has a malformed YC tag, the tool can crash when attempting to deserialize the YC tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Check the error message for the read name of the BAM record with the malformed YC tag. This usually indicates a problem with upstream tools. Alternatively, you can bypass YC tag deserialization by enabling `--disable-base-type-decoding`.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Full read     | Reads with a complete insert. UMIs are currently used as a proxy for determining full reads by considering any read that contains both expected UMIs (e.g., both 5' and 3' UMIs are present) as full.                                 |
| Partial read  | A read with an incomplete insert. UMIs are currently used as a proxy for determining partial reads by considering any read that is missing one of the two expected UMIs (e.g., only a 5' UMI or only a 3' UMI is present) as partial. |
